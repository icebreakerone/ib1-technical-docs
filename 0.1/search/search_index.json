An access rule contains: Zero or more conditions for access One or more capability grants to the data consumer if access is granted Zero or more obligations falling on the data consumer if access is granted They are applied to properties of a Data Consumer while processing a request for data from a Data Provider . These properties can be modelled as a map of names to values; some values may be inferred by joining on the ID of the data consumer, some may be directly provided in the Token introspection response. Syntax Names Names consist of a namespace ( [a-z0-9_]+ ), a : character, and a suffix ( [a-z0-9_.]+ ). For example, ib1:some_value . Values asserted by Icebreaker One will always have a namespace ib1 . The suffix may contain . characters, the namespace may not. Rule syntax An access rule is represented as a single line string containing a comma separated list of zero or more Conditions, the literal string grants , and then a comma separated list of one or more Capabilities. Optionally, this may be followed by the literal requires and one or more Obligations in a comma separated list. [CONDITION]? [\",\" CONDITION]* \"grants\" CAPABILITY [\",\" CAPABILITY]* [\"requires\" OBLIGATION+ [\",\" OBLIGATION] NOTE : * A rule with no conditions is valid, and is satisfied by all requests * All rules must grant at least one capability * Rules may have zero or more obligations See the following sections for specification of conditions and capabilities. Conditions Conditions are unary or binary clauses. All conditions must be satisfied within a rule for that rule to be applied. There are no explicit boolean operators such as or or similar. For cases where alternative sets of rules could be applied the expectation is that data providers will specify multiple, potentially overlapping, rules to express this. Unary clauses Unary clauses consist of a single named condition. The clause is satisfied if that condition is true . This is typically used to denote a particular property such as Icebreaker One Trust Framework membership or similar where the existence of the property is sufficient to accept the data consumer. {\"ib1:member\" : true} Binary clauses Binary clauses consist of a name on the left hand side, an operator , and a value on the right hand side. The valid operators are shown in the table below. LHS, operator, and RHS are separated with at least one space character. Values can be numerals, dates, quoted strings, or homogeneous lists of these three types. Dates are specified as dd/mm/yyyy , we do not need a higher level of precision in any of our envisaged use cases, but if this is needed a datetime must be specified as a string compliant with RFC3339 . To simplify expression in JSON , quoted strings should be enclosed in single quote ' characters. Lists are written as a comma separated list of strings surrounded by [ and ] characters. Lists are only valid RHS values for the in operator. Operators Operator Range Description is Any The condition passes if the value of the property on the LHS is exactly equal to the value in the RHS before date or datetime The condition passes if the value of the property on the LHS is before the date or datetime specifed as the RHS. Where a date needs to be coerced to a datetime, it is done by setting it to 00:00.00 with the same date after date or datetime As above, but passes if the value of the property on the LHS is after the date or datetime specified on the RHS. max_age_days date or datetime The condition passes if the value on the LHS corresponds to a date at most X days in the past compared to the current date, where X is integer numeral specified as the RHS < , <= , >= , > , == number Conditions pass if the LHS is, respectively, less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal, greater than, or strictly equal, to the number on the RHS. Note that == and is are equivalent for numeric quantities in number or string Conditions pass if there is at least one item in the list specified in the RHS which would match the is condition with respect to the LHS value Example conditions NOTE : The conditions shown below are examples, and should not be taken as indicative of standard properties of data consumers in the final system. Example condition clauses Condition Interpretation ib1:status is 'active' passes if the value of ib1:status is set, and is equal under string comparison to active ib1:membership_expires after 24/10/2022 passes if the value of ib1:membership_expires is either a date or a datetime, and is after the 24th October 2022 ib1:terms_signed max_age_days 20 passes if the value of ib1:terms_signed is either a date or a datetime, and is at most 20 days from the current datetime. Note that dates with no time component are equivalent to 00:00.00 on the specified date for comparison purposes some_group:membership_level >= 2 passes if the value of some_group:membership_level is a number and is greater to or equal to two. ib1:org_type in ['council', 'academic'] passes if the value of ib1:org_type would be considered equal to either 'council' or 'academic' as if compared with is . ib1:member passes if the value of ib1:member is true . Specifying multiple conditions Multiple conditions are separated with , characters. All conditions must be satisfied for the rule to pass, there are no sub-clauses or boolean operators. Any number of space characters are allowed before and after the , in a condition list. For example, ib1:status is 'active', some_group:membership_level >=2 is the union of those two example conditions from the previous section and will only be satisfied if both conditions are individually satisfiable. Capabilities Capability grants for a given set of access conditions are specified as a comma ( , ) separated list of names . There MUST be at least one name in this list, an empty capability grant list is not considered valid. Standard capabilities These are capabilities where the namespace part of the name is ib1 , indicating that they are defined as part of the Icebreaker One Trust Framework. Data providers SHOULD NOT , create their own capabilities unless absolutely necessary as doing so acts against the aim of easy interoperability and comprehension of access and licensing rules. Any additional capabilities designed MUST be prefixed with the organisation ID of the data provider responsible for their definition, and any such data provider MUST publish a clear, legally valid, definition of any such capabilities. In addition, data providers creating custom capabilities MUST inform the TFGS of this, providing links to the aforementioned documentation. WARNING : This section is provisional, the exact final set of base capabilities has yet to be determined. Those shown below are a plausible first cut but should not be considered definitive.

An open data set by definition has no access conditions, so any access rules for such data sets MUST have an empty access condition list, and must use one of the following capabilities to declare that the data are licensed under a known OSI approved open license Rules MUST NOT grant a mix of capabilities in the open namespace and capabilities in other namespaces, as the semantics of this are not well defined.

These translate to \u201ctags\u201d in our web interface and are useful to group data sets around specific topics. dcat:keyword: - solar - electricity - retrofit Access Block This section describes the kinds of licensing, expressed as sets of capabilities, and what, if any, conditions must be satisfied before a data consumer can acquire these data. Each item within this section contains: A statement describing a set of conditions which must be satisfied to grant access, and the set of capabilities granted should access be provided by this set of conditions. The exact specification for these statements can be found at Access Control and Capability Grant Language A boolean property indicating whether the access conditions in [1] are sufficient ( true ), or simply indicative ( false ). In the former case, a data consumer which satisfies all the conditions will be granted access, in the latter they may be granted access, but there may be additional requirements not fully described here A pair of dates indicating the time range for which this access condition is valid. Data providers are encouraged to commit to access and license conditions with a reasonable timeframe to allow potential consumers to plan their own activities access: # Access constraint to licensing predicates - rule: ib1:verified, ib1:last_update max_age_days 60 grants ib1:use_any sufficient: true appliesFrom: 2023-04-22 appliesTo: 2024-04-22 - rule: group:some_group grants ib1:use_any, ib1:adapt_any sufficient: false appliesFrom: 2023-04-22 appliesTo: 2024-04-22 Transport Block This section describes the on the wire transport protocol, normally HTTP, but with scope to describe out-of-band transports with an initial HTTP negotiation process. It contains at least a single http key, the value of which must be valid OpenAPI For example: transport: http: # This block is mandatory, and contains the Open|API| spec for the secured or open # HTTP endpoints (depending on data class) openapi: 3.0.0 info: title: Sample API description: CSV format data version: 0.1.0 servers: - url: http://data-provider-example.com description: Describe this particular server if needed paths: \"/data\": get: summary: Returns a CSV containing all the data description: If we had any more to describe, we'd do it here responses: '200': description: CSV data stream NOTE : Because API security is defined in relation to the data sensitivity class of the data set, it is not necessary to define the security of any presented API in this section. Data sets in class IB1-O must expose an API with no extra security measures, and those in IB1-SA and IB1-SB must be secured by FAPI using the Ib1 Trust Framework services. Heartbeat URL Data providers SHOULD create a secured endpoint to act as a heartbeat - if this is specifed then the TFGS will periodically call it to assertain liveness and optionally gather metrics as described in Heartbeat and monitoring endpoint A hearbeat URL can be specified as a single key heartbeat_url with the value being the fully qualified URL at which the hearbeat response is exposed. Representation Block This section describes the format of any data received by a data consumer from this data set. The IB1 Trust Framework does not mandate particular formats, so this section is guidance rather than specification. The only required element in this section is a key mime which should contain the media type of the returned data. At a bare minimum this allows a client to load data into some kind of tooling. Depending on this value, other objects may be present. text/csv This type indicates that data is presented in CSV format. In this case, an optional key csvw may be defined, and should contain valid JSON-LD following the CSV for the Web guidelines: representation: mime: text/csv csvw: # This is only applicable if the mime type is text/csv \"@context\": http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw tableSchema: columns: - titles: country - titles: country group - titles: name (en) - titles: name (fr) - titles: name (de) - titles: latitude - titles: longitude Other types This is currently open for consultation, we would like to be able to guide data providers towards particular representation types for particular kinds of information, and make use of any existing ontologies or standards such as the Common Information Model where such standards will aid interoperability between IB1 Trust Framework participants and the wider community.

Commercial","title":"Considerations for Data Consumers"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/","text":"Core Policies Introduction (Core Policies) This section aims to outline core policies and principles with implications for all members of the Icebreaker One Trust Framework. Development of detailed guidance and tooling to accompany the policies in this section is a priority for future development and will be approached openly; using consultation with Advisory Groups , tester organisations and members to ensure that resources meet member needs. All terminology used in this section is outlined in the Glossary . Metadata Data sets are described by Data Providers through metadata files. The format for these can be found at Data Set Metadata Data Sensitivity Classes The IB1 Trust Framework incorporates a range of categories of data that have varied levels of sensitivity. In order to handle this complexity, and to ensure data is appropriately protected, Icebreaker One has developed a system of data sensitivity classification. Policy details The IB1 Trust Framework operates a system of five data sensitivity classes, graded across three dimensions of sensitivity: personal, commercial, and security. Personal sensitivity considers data defined as \u2018personal data\u2019 by the UK DPA 2018, and related privacy and consumer protection implications. Commercial sensitivity considers intellectual property, risk and commerciality. Security sensitivity includes critical national infrastructure and cybersecurity. Classes are presented in the table below. A definition, specification and dataset examples for each class is provided in the IB1 Trust Framework Operational Guidelines. Data Providers assess their datasets using the Operational Guidelines and allocate them to a class, prior to sharing them via the Trust Framework. Data Sensitivity Classes are designed to supplement, not replace, the Modernising Energy Data Best Practice Guidance (Point 12) determining whether data should be made Open, Shared or Closed. In particular, The Data Sensitivity Classes are designed to provide further nuance to the category of Shared data - identifying three different classes in this space, with different sensitivity profiles. Data sensitivity classes in the IB1 Trust Framework Data Class Description Example Datasets Personal Sensitivity Commercial Sensitivity Security Sensitivity IB1-C Closed data - limited to internal organisational access only or limited, bespoke bilateral contracts under specific circumstances. May be subject to hard legal barriers to sharing.

Data access refers to determining what types of conditions may be specified for Data Consumers to meet in order to gain access to datasets in different sensitivity classes, and how access rules are articulated. This policy has been created with input from the IB1 Trust Framework Advisory Groups, Review Track, and public consultation responses. The Trust Framework Governance Service ( TFGS ) is responsible for providing Data Providers with verified information about Data Consumers , in line with specified access conditions for each dataset. However, the Data Provider is solely responsible for determining whether any given API request should be honoured (i.e. data access granted), and the licensing terms for any data returned in response to that request. This is due to requirements for control to rest with the Data Provider only. It is expected that Data Providers will grant access reliably and fairly, in line with the access conditions that they specify. In the event that access is refused, there will be a mechanism for flagging this with the TFGS for review and dispute management. Data Providers must be able to show clear justification for access refusal. Repeat refusal or non-compliance with specified access conditions may result in penalties (to be determined after Phase 3). This policy focuses on access conditions for classes IB1-SA and IB1-SB only. Personal data ( IB1-SP ) are currently out of scope. Future extensibility of the IB1 Trust Framework to IB1-SP data will be consulted on in future phases of project development. Policy details (Data access conditions) Data Providers will allocate each of their datasets to a sensitivity class prior to sharing them within the IB1 Trust Framework. Data access conditions will then be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the sensitivity profile of each class. We propose to use the data sensitivity classes previously established as a basis for considering access conditions, but not as a complete determinant. Our approach must serve the goal of reducing friction in sharing data, while also balancing two distinct sets of needs: Data Providers : to retain control over their data. Data Consumers and Service Providers : to access multiple datasets in a clear and manageable way. As such, we define a standardised range of access condition types as a mechanism to balance the factors outlined above. This acknowledges the need for more nuance than would be captured under a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach for each sensitivity class. Instead, our policy enables some tailoring within defined parameters. The table below describes access conditions for each of the data sensitivity classes. It also demonstrates the rationale for this guidance - identifying the lack of standardised access conditions for IB1-SA and IB1-SB datasets as a cause of cost and friction in data sharing. Data sensitivity classes and access conditions in scope Data Class Access Conditions IB1-C Determined and governed by the Data Provider only. IB1-SP Currently determined by legislation including, but not limited to: GDPR / DPA 2018, the Data Access and Privacy Framework, and the Smart Energy Code. Data Providers may also apply additional non-standard access conditions, such as payment or purpose-based.

IB1-SB and IB1-SA Group based access control There are two ways in which group-based access can be defined. The group can be externally defined. In this case, an external source provides documentation group membership and duration. For example, a group could be created that encompasses all UK retail energy suppliers licensed by Ofgem, or the members of a research consortium listed on a particular grant. In both cases, group membership is clearly defined by an external document (e.g. Ofgem licensee list, grant contract) applicable for a defined time period. The group can be self-defined. In this case, documentation of group membership and duration is provided by group members themselves. For example, a set of organisations partnering on a particular use-case or commercial partnership may be able to self-define as a group. Documentation may comprise a project plan or multilateral commercial agreement. Further policy-development is required to ensure the inclusion of self-defining groups in the IB1 Trust Framework is fair and transparent. Appropriate governance arrangements will also need to be established, for example to prevent confusion for Data Providers or instability associated with too-frequent changes in group creation or membership. As such, it is likely that group-based access defined through authoritative external sources will be explored first in TFGS development going forward. Use case based access control This type of access condition is difficult to design due to inherent subjectivity in defining the bounds and meaning of particular use cases. While some Data Providers could be comfortable granting access on the basis of broadly defined use cases, such as fuel poverty reduction, this may not be appropriate to all Data Providers or for more sensitive datasets. As such, it is proposed that use case-based access could also be facilitated through the creation of either externally-defined or self-defined groups as outlined above. For example, partners within a Local Authority social housing retrofit project could form a group. This group would be accompanied by information about the specific use case it represents - for example participants, timescale, activities, commercial status etc.) enabling Data Providers to make an informed decision regarding whether to grant access. Any future consideration of access based on more broadly-defined use-cases would be subject to consultation and further policy development. Prioritisation Inclusion of all access conditions outlined above will require significant technical build. In the near future, Icebreaker One may prioritise the establishment of access conditions that industry feedback has indicated take priority. These include: payment, security compliance, regulatory compliance and externally defined groups. As flagged above, in order to maintain robust governance and the IB1 Trust Framework, development of additional access conditions may require further policy work. Data Licensing This policy has been created with input from the IB1 Trust Framework Advisory Groups, Review Track, and public consultation responses. These policies are presented jointly as they unite the processes of determining who can access a particular dataset and what can be done with that dataset. Please note that this policy does not outline draft legal text of the final licences - this is being developed separately with legal support. All ideas outlined in this document remain subject to legal assessment. Creating access rules The previous section on Data Access established a set of concerns (e.g. group-based access, payment-based access etc.) which may be considered when determining who can access a dataset. To facilitate this policy, we propose a system whereby access and capability grants are determined, for each request to a Data Provider \u2019s API , on the basis of a set of rules defined and published by that Data Provider . Grants are based on three sources of information: Information from the Trust Framework Governance Service ( TFGS ) about the Data Consumer making the request Information known by the Data Provider (separately from the Trust Framework) about the Data Consumer making the request, such as customer status, commercial relationships, bilateral agreements, active payments/subscriptions or similar Rules defined by the Data Provider - predicated on information provided by TFGS and/or, where necessary to preserve privacy or security, properties known to the Data Provider only Information provided by TFGS to Data Providers can cover two kinds of properties: Inherently true properties known to the TFGS , such as: The unique ID of the Data Consumer The Data Consumer represents a Local Authority / SME / Enterprise / Community Organisation / Academic group, etc The Data Consumer has a particular identity such as a registered name The TFGS has performed identity assurance to a particular level Transient, time-bounded properties known to the Trust Framework, such as: The Data Consumer is a member of a particular scheme, group, or consortium (e.g. a two-year academic research project under a particular named grant) The Data Consumer has signed a particular document on a particular date (e.g. documentation of a research partnership) When defining an access rule, Data Providers will also be required to confirm whether the rule is definitive or indicative. Definitive rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions will be given access. Indicative rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions may be given access, but there may also be other conditions (e.g. the existence of a payment or bilateral agreement) that must be confirmed by the Data Provider outside the Trust Framework before access is granted. If access requests are refused, Data Providers must be able to demonstrate a justifiable reason for doing so. Data Consumers can challenge access refusals through a dispute-resolution mechanism (part of the TFGS ) if this is required. Guidance regarding acceptable/unacceptable reasons for access refusal, the dispute-resolution mechanism, and TFGS dispute-resolution processes will be developed and published in Phase 4 of the project. The flow of information associated with access control is shown below - this assumes the Data Consumer has already acquired an access token from the authorization server. Access control and capability grants are processed on a per-request basis, within the Data Provider . Associating access rules with capabilities In the IB1 Trust Framework model, licensing is expressed as the grant of a set of capabilities and associated obligations, scoped to the results of a single API call and verified through a non-repudiable digital signature. This is defined using a rules language, the details of which can be found at Access Control and Capability Grant Language What are licenses and capabilities? A data licence is a legal instrument setting out what a Data Consumer can do with a particular artefact (e.g. dataset). This grants certain \u2018capabilities\u2019 to the Data Consumer , comprising a clear expression of things they can do with the artefact. For example, the CC-BY 4.0 Creative Commons licence is highly permissive, granting capabilities such as: reuse of the licensed artefact for any purpose, redistribution of the artefact, and sharing derivatives of the artefact - so long as the author is credited with the original. By contrast, the CC-BY-ND 4.0 Creative Commons licence grants the capability to reuse the licensed artefact for any purpose, however it does not grant the capability to redistribute derivatives of the artefact. How do capability grants work in practice? Each time a Data Consumer makes an API call, the data returned will be associated with a particular set of capability grants. These can be bound to the data through a non-repudiable digital signature, designed to ensure transparency in the event of any disputes regarding data use. Capability grants will be converted into a licence through the TFGS . Alongside the legal text of the licence, the TFGS will make details of capabilities available to Data Consumers as an easy to understand set of notation/icons. Open Net Zero will also show the license (capabilities and obligations) associated with a dataset in the search results, allowing for searches to be filtered by license in order to promote transparency from the outset. The IB1 Trust Framework defines a set of common capabilities - Data Providers may create custom capabilities, but we strongly suggest that this should only be done in exceptional cases. The common initial set of capabilities can be found at Standard capabilities . We propose to use this list as the building blocks for our system of capability grants; whereby the range of capabilities, associated legal text, and \u2018human readable\u2019 notation/icons is standardised within the IB1 Trust Framework. NOTE : There is potential for redistribution of derivatives to be managed in more granularity through use of the data pyramid (see Figure 2 below). This could permit Data Providers to specify what level of derivative insights can be passed on (e.g. raw data / results of analysis / recommendations building on analysis). Obligations accompanying capability grants Capability grants will be accompanied by details of any obligations that the Data Consumer must abide by when exercising a capability. Data Providers must specify any such obligations when associating capabilities with an access rule. As with capabilities, the range of obligations will be standardised within the IB1 Trust Framework and will be included in the digital signature binding the API return with the capability grant. Icebreaker One research has identified a set of common obligations associated with capabilities granted by licences. These include obligations to: Credit the author(s) of the original artefact. Provide a statement accompanying derivatives works/products/services explaining that the original (credited) artefact was used in their creation. Provide ownership statements for derivative works/products/services. License any derivative works/products/services with the same capabilities (\u2018share-alike\u2019). Establish a limit in liability for use of the data in its current state. We propose to use this list as the building blocks for our system of obligations accompanying capability grants; whereby the range of associations, associated legal text, and \u2018human readable\u2019 notation/icons is standardised within the IB1 Trust Framework. Why are we proposing this approach? Constructing a single licence for each dataset, designed to govern all possible scenarios for its use, has to date resulted in the creation of long, complex licensing agreements that are not easily readable by Data Consumers . Industry feedback indicates that this creates friction and costs, for example associated with data-related legal support or accidental misuse of licensed data. These issues are further compounded by growth in the creation of bespoke licences that include non-standard capabilities or legal wording. Icebreaker One has identified an alternative approach to single data licences, which is currently more commonly used within data science and software development communities outside of the energy sector. This approach permits dual or multiple licensing of an artefact, whereby the individual licences are kept as simple as possible. For example, dual licensing is commonly used in circumstances where software code is released for free under one licence, then to paying customers under a more permissive licence. Our approach accepts that a degree of licence pluralism is necessary, and indeed valuable, in supporting a diversity of data types, actors and use-cases within the energy data ecosystem. We are aware that a multiple licensing approach may prompt some concern regarding a risk of licence proliferation and/or opacity. However, our approach can reduce these risks by rationalising and standardising the parameters in which licensing occurs. To do this, Icebreaker One will work to standardise the range of capabilities offered, the legal text governing how these capabilities are expressed, and the \u2018human-readable\u2019 ways in which these capabilities are communicated to Data Consumers . In future, we will further develop guidance for Data Providers encouraging simplicity and discouraging unnecessary protectionism, while also maintaining appropriate protections for higher sensitivity classes of data. Early feedback from Advisory Groups and critical friends has suggested that benefits of this approach could include reduced legal, staff and time costs associated with improved searchability, transparency, readability and standardisation of capability grants. By making licensing simpler and faster, it could also help level the digital playing field by offering particular benefits to new, small or \u2018public interest\u2019 actors lacking in-house expertise or budget. In the longer term, adoption of this approach could have benefits across the sector as new data markets incentivise Data Providers to align with IB1 Trust Framework standardisation. Example access control and capability grant scenarios NOTE : These scenarios have been created to reflect decisions that could be faced by Data Providers in the Open Energy Phase 3 ( OE3 ) use-case, in which a Local Authority is seeking data to plan the retrofit of social housing with low carbon technologies. Please note that the scenarios are exemplary only and do not necessarily represent the stances of any Data Providers involved in testing. Scenario 1 Dataset DNO capacity/constraint data Sensitivity class IB1-SA Access control domains Access granted to all Trust Framework members equally Access rules ib1:member unary access condition Capability grants ib1:member grants ib1:use_any , all Data Consumers who are members of the Trust Framework can access this data set, and receive the right to use for any purpose (see Standard capabilities for more detail) Obligations Derivatives of the artefact must be accompanied by text stating that the original artefact was used in their creation. ib1:member grants ib1:use_any requires ib1:by (see Standard obligations for more detail) Scenario 2 Dataset Public Electric vehicle chargepoint use and economic performance profiles Sensitivity class IB1-SB Access control domains Group-based and payment-based access conditions Access rules Two distinct access constraints: ib1:org_type in ['local_authority', 'academic'], provider:customer_level == 1 - local authorities and educational institutions are granted access if they are paid customers of the Data Provider at their standard rate provider:customer_level >= 2 - energy networks are granted access if they are paid customers of the Data Provider at their large business level Capability grants In this scenario it would be technically possible for the Data Provider to apply different capability grants to the two different access rules. In this case the Data Provider chooses not to as they have charged commercial entities a higher access fee and are therefore happy for all Data Consumers to be granted the same capabilities. The result is the same set of capabilities (the same licence) is applied to both access rules. ib1:org_type in ['local_authority', 'academic'], provider:customer_level == 1 grants ib1:use_any provider:customer_level >= 2 grants ib1:use_any Obligations The Data Provider chooses the same obligations to be applied to both access rules ib1:org_type in ['local_authority', 'academic'], provider:customer_level == 1 grants ib1:use_any requires ib1:by provider:customer_level >= 2 grants ib1:use_any requires ib1:by NOTE : Scenario 2 This more complex scenario detailed above involves a combination of properties known to the IB1 Trust Framework (the market sector of the Data Consumer - Local Authority, Educational Institution, or Energy Network) along with properties which are only known to the Data Provider (the payment status of the Data Consumer ). We can do this because the rules are evaluated within the Data Provider , and not externally within the Trust Framework's Governance Service, an entity which is not aware of any commercial arrangements between the Data Provider and Data Consumer . Scenario 3 Dataset Solar panel performance data Sensitivity class IB1-SB Access control domains Use case-based and payment-based access conditions Access rules Two rules are created: ib1_group:plymouth_lct - access to use case participants, here defined as a group lct managed by plymouth (the ID of a local council organisation) and administered using the TFGS facilities provider:customer - access to all other Trust Framework members if they have a paid account with the Data Provider Capability grants The Data Provider chooses to apply two different capability grants (dual licences) for the two access rules, reflecting the fact that their dataset is commercially sensitive, therefore they require payment for its use beyond non-profit or development activities. ib1_group:plymouth_lct grants ib1:use_dev, ib1:use_noncom provider:customer grants ib1:use_any, ib1:redistribute_combined, ib1:combine_any, ib1:adapt_any Obligations The original source of the artefact must be credited in all direct uses, derivatives of the artefact must be. accompanied by text stating that the original artefact was used in their creation, and derivatives must be licensed under the same terms as the original: ib1_group:plymouth_lct grants ib1:use_dev, ib1:use_noncom requires ib1:sa, ib1:by The original source of the artefact must be credited in all direct uses, and derivatives of the artefact must be accompanied by text stating that the original artefact was used in their creation. There is no obligation to license derivatives of the artefact under the same terms as the original: provider:customer grants ib1:use_any, ib1:redistribute_combined, ib1:combine_any, ib1:adapt_any requires ib1:by Risks of license proliferation As outlined in previous consultations, the general case of data ecosystems is more complex than Open Banking. We are therefore proposing a different approach to licensing in order to balance a wide range of needs and data types. The approach further responds to feedback from our Advisory Groups and Review Track that data access and licensing cannot be served by a one size fits all approach as this would risk restricting the diversity of the ecosystem and potentially undermining the strength of the trust framework. We are aware of concerns within the industry that multiple licensing could present risks of licence proliferation, introducing complexity to the landscape which can act as a barrier for data consumption. Icebreaker One acknowledges this risk and presents the following points of response: Firstly, some stakeholders have suggested that IB1 should take a \u2018modular approach\u2019 to building a \u2018single IB1 licence\u2019. This suggestion outlines a permissive core or standard licence that is presented to all Data Providers as the default option for publishing their data. If this is not appropriate for a particular dataset, Data Providers would then have the option of adding restrictions (i.e. removing capabilities) by adding modular sections of legal text. In practice however, a modular approach doesn\u2019t reduce licence plurality as each modification of a licence (e.g. addition of modular text) is viewed legally as the creation of a new licence. Icebreaker One\u2019s approach instead accepts a degree of licence plurality, but will work to standardise the discoverability, scope and ease of understanding of that pluralism by offering a limited, standardised and searchable range of capabilities. This will be accompanied in due course by guidance for Data Providers , tailored to each sensitivity class, encouraging as much openness as possible while publishing data safely and creating a thriving marketplace. Secondly, we acknowledge that the data landscape already incorporates a significant degree of licence proliferation. For example, it is already common for system actors to publish data under bespoke licences containing non-standard clauses and/or legal wording. In standardising the range and expression of capabilities, Icebreaker One aims to rationalise some unnecessary forms of licence proliferation in the sector and reduce legal costs to Data Providers by reducing the circumstances under which bespoke licences are necessary. Is there a risk of licences changing too frequently or without notice? In any licensing model that is not explicitly time-bound, there is a risk that the Data Provider may choose to change the licence arbitrarily. We have received feedback that bespoke licensing in the energy sector already produces insecurity for Data Consumers , who are concerned about the longevity of particular licences in a changeable environment. For example, an energy forecasting company relies on predictable access to, and capabilities to use, a range of datasets (e.g. weather data). Changes to the capabilities granted for any of these datasets undermine this kind of business model, with additional proxy consequences for carbon savings that could be achieved as a result of better integration of renewable energy generation. Icebreaker One aims to address this problem by encouraging Data Providers to indicate the length of time they commit to retaining the same capability grant for a particular access rule. Although this will be optional, we hope that Data Providers will be incentivised to do so as this encourages confidence in the market. We are also exploring the possibility of building a notification system to alert Data Consumers either to upcoming or new changes in capability grants to ensure this is done transparently and with adequate warning where possible. NOTE : The time ranges described above are NOT a time limit on the capabilities granted in response to a single request, it instead specifies a range within which the access rules and their corresponding capability grants will not change. Beyond designing positive behavioural and market incentives, it is beyond the scope of the IB1 Trust Framework to control licence-changes as this remains within the legal rights of the Data Provider . Where are these rules specified? The access control, capability, and obligation grants form part of the metadata for a dataset. This is expressed in a file, hosted and maintained by the Data Provider responsible for the data set. The provisional structure of the entire file can be found at Data Set Metadata , in particular the section on the Access Block Where are these rules evaluated, and by whom? Following our guiding principle that Data Providers remain in control of their data at all times, these rules are evaluated within the Data Provider API implementation. This is necessary to allow for decisions predicated on information only known to the Data Provider , but this could impose additional complexity when setting up and implementing a Data Provider . To mitigate this, we provide clear specifications and semantics for the rules language, along with a reference implementation in the Python language. The current language specification can be found at Access Control and Capability Grant Language , the time bounds and other properties form part of the Access Block specification in the metadata file format. Service Desk and Notifications Icebreaker One acknowledges industry feedback regarding the need to develop a Service Desk and notifications function. Developing the full function is an active area for future development. In the meantime, members will be directed to use a specific email address to catalogue emerging needs and discuss appropriate TFGS support. We propose to use learning from this prototype to inform future service and policy design. Dispute Resolution Icebreaker One acknowledges industry feedback regarding the need to develop a dispute resolution function as part of the TFGS . Developing the full function of dispute resolution is an active area for future development. Given the complexity of this topic, ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation will be used to shape the future service. In the meantime, members will be requested to use a specific email address to catalogue any difficulties and discuss appropriate TFGS support. Learning from this prototype will inform future service and policy design, alongside consultation activity.","title":"Core Policies"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#core-policies","text":"","title":"Core Policies"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#introduction-core-policies","text":"This section aims to outline core policies and principles with implications for all members of the Icebreaker One Trust Framework.

In both cases, group membership is clearly defined by an external document (e.g. Ofgem licensee list, grant contract) applicable for a defined time period. The group can be self-defined. In this case, documentation of group membership and duration is provided by group members themselves. For example, a set of organisations partnering on a particular use-case or commercial partnership may be able to self-define as a group. Documentation may comprise a project plan or multilateral commercial agreement. Further policy-development is required to ensure the inclusion of self-defining groups in the IB1 Trust Framework is fair and transparent.

For example, partners within a Local Authority social housing retrofit project could form a group. This group would be accompanied by information about the specific use case it represents - for example participants, timescale, activities, commercial status etc.) enabling Data Providers to make an informed decision regarding whether to grant access.

To facilitate this policy, we propose a system whereby access and capability grants are determined, for each request to a Data Provider \u2019s API , on the basis of a set of rules defined and published by that Data Provider . Grants are based on three sources of information: Information from the Trust Framework Governance Service ( TFGS ) about the Data Consumer making the request Information known by the Data Provider (separately from the Trust Framework) about the Data Consumer making the request, such as customer status, commercial relationships, bilateral agreements, active payments/subscriptions or similar Rules defined by the Data Provider - predicated on information provided by TFGS and/or, where necessary to preserve privacy or security, properties known to the Data Provider only Information provided by TFGS to Data Providers can cover two kinds of properties: Inherently true properties known to the TFGS , such as: The unique ID of the Data Consumer The Data Consumer represents a Local Authority / SME / Enterprise / Community Organisation / Academic group, etc The Data Consumer has a particular identity such as a registered name The TFGS has performed identity assurance to a particular level Transient, time-bounded properties known to the Trust Framework, such as: The Data Consumer is a member of a particular scheme, group, or consortium (e.g. a two-year academic research project under a particular named grant) The Data Consumer has signed a particular document on a particular date (e.g. documentation of a research partnership) When defining an access rule, Data Providers will also be required to confirm whether the rule is definitive or indicative. Definitive rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions will be given access. Indicative rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions may be given access, but there may also be other conditions (e.g. the existence of a payment or bilateral agreement) that must be confirmed by the Data Provider outside the Trust Framework before access is granted. If access requests are refused, Data Providers must be able to demonstrate a justifiable reason for doing so. Data Consumers can challenge access refusals through a dispute-resolution mechanism (part of the TFGS ) if this is required. Guidance regarding acceptable/unacceptable reasons for access refusal, the dispute-resolution mechanism, and TFGS dispute-resolution processes will be developed and published in Phase 4 of the project. The flow of information associated with access control is shown below - this assumes the Data Consumer has already acquired an access token from the authorization server.

For example, the CC-BY 4.0 Creative Commons licence is highly permissive, granting capabilities such as: reuse of the licensed artefact for any purpose, redistribution of the artefact, and sharing derivatives of the artefact - so long as the author is credited with the original. By contrast, the CC-BY-ND 4.0 Creative Commons licence grants the capability to reuse the licensed artefact for any purpose, however it does not grant the capability to redistribute derivatives of the artefact.","title":"What are licenses and capabilities?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#how-do-capability-grants-work-in-practice","text":"Each time a Data Consumer makes an API call, the data returned will be associated with a particular set of capability grants. These can be bound to the data through a non-repudiable digital signature, designed to ensure transparency in the event of any disputes regarding data use. Capability grants will be converted into a licence through the TFGS . Alongside the legal text of the licence, the TFGS will make details of capabilities available to Data Consumers as an easy to understand set of notation/icons. Open Net Zero will also show the license (capabilities and obligations) associated with a dataset in the search results, allowing for searches to be filtered by license in order to promote transparency from the outset. The IB1 Trust Framework defines a set of common capabilities - Data Providers may create custom capabilities, but we strongly suggest that this should only be done in exceptional cases. The common initial set of capabilities can be found at Standard capabilities . We propose to use this list as the building blocks for our system of capability grants; whereby the range of capabilities, associated legal text, and \u2018human readable\u2019 notation/icons is standardised within the IB1 Trust Framework. NOTE : There is potential for redistribution of derivatives to be managed in more granularity through use of the data pyramid (see Figure 2 below). This could permit Data Providers to specify what level of derivative insights can be passed on (e.g. raw data / results of analysis / recommendations building on analysis).","title":"How do capability grants work in practice?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#obligations-accompanying-capability-grants","text":"Capability grants will be accompanied by details of any obligations that the Data Consumer must abide by when exercising a capability.

Icebreaker One research has identified a set of common obligations associated with capabilities granted by licences. These include obligations to: Credit the author(s) of the original artefact. Provide a statement accompanying derivatives works/products/services explaining that the original (credited) artefact was used in their creation. Provide ownership statements for derivative works/products/services. License any derivative works/products/services with the same capabilities (\u2018share-alike\u2019).

Industry feedback indicates that this creates friction and costs, for example associated with data-related legal support or accidental misuse of licensed data. These issues are further compounded by growth in the creation of bespoke licences that include non-standard capabilities or legal wording. Icebreaker One has identified an alternative approach to single data licences, which is currently more commonly used within data science and software development communities outside of the energy sector. This approach permits dual or multiple licensing of an artefact, whereby the individual licences are kept as simple as possible. For example, dual licensing is commonly used in circumstances where software code is released for free under one licence, then to paying customers under a more permissive licence. Our approach accepts that a degree of licence pluralism is necessary, and indeed valuable, in supporting a diversity of data types, actors and use-cases within the energy data ecosystem. We are aware that a multiple licensing approach may prompt some concern regarding a risk of licence proliferation and/or opacity. However, our approach can reduce these risks by rationalising and standardising the parameters in which licensing occurs. To do this, Icebreaker One will work to standardise the range of capabilities offered, the legal text governing how these capabilities are expressed, and the \u2018human-readable\u2019 ways in which these capabilities are communicated to Data Consumers . In future, we will further develop guidance for Data Providers encouraging simplicity and discouraging unnecessary protectionism, while also maintaining appropriate protections for higher sensitivity classes of data. Early feedback from Advisory Groups and critical friends has suggested that benefits of this approach could include reduced legal, staff and time costs associated with improved searchability, transparency, readability and standardisation of capability grants. By making licensing simpler and faster, it could also help level the digital playing field by offering particular benefits to new, small or \u2018public interest\u2019 actors lacking in-house expertise or budget. In the longer term, adoption of this approach could have benefits across the sector as new data markets incentivise Data Providers to align with IB1 Trust Framework standardisation.","title":"Why are we proposing this approach?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#example-access-control-and-capability-grant-scenarios","text":"NOTE : These scenarios have been created to reflect decisions that could be faced by Data Providers in the Open Energy Phase 3 ( OE3 ) use-case, in which a Local Authority is seeking data to plan the retrofit of social housing with low carbon technologies.

We are therefore proposing a different approach to licensing in order to balance a wide range of needs and data types. The approach further responds to feedback from our Advisory Groups and Review Track that data access and licensing cannot be served by a one size fits all approach as this would risk restricting the diversity of the ecosystem and potentially undermining the strength of the trust framework. We are aware of concerns within the industry that multiple licensing could present risks of licence proliferation, introducing complexity to the landscape which can act as a barrier for data consumption. Icebreaker One acknowledges this risk and presents the following points of response: Firstly, some stakeholders have suggested that IB1 should take a \u2018modular approach\u2019 to building a \u2018single IB1 licence\u2019. This suggestion outlines a permissive core or standard licence that is presented to all Data Providers as the default option for publishing their data. If this is not appropriate for a particular dataset, Data Providers would then have the option of adding restrictions (i.e. removing capabilities) by adding modular sections of legal text. In practice however, a modular approach doesn\u2019t reduce licence plurality as each modification of a licence (e.g. addition of modular text) is viewed legally as the creation of a new licence. Icebreaker One\u2019s approach instead accepts a degree of licence plurality, but will work to standardise the discoverability, scope and ease of understanding of that pluralism by offering a limited, standardised and searchable range of capabilities. This will be accompanied in due course by guidance for Data Providers , tailored to each sensitivity class, encouraging as much openness as possible while publishing data safely and creating a thriving marketplace. Secondly, we acknowledge that the data landscape already incorporates a significant degree of licence proliferation. For example, it is already common for system actors to publish data under bespoke licences containing non-standard clauses and/or legal wording. In standardising the range and expression of capabilities, Icebreaker One aims to rationalise some unnecessary forms of licence proliferation in the sector and reduce legal costs to Data Providers by reducing the circumstances under which bespoke licences are necessary.","title":"Risks of license proliferation"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#is-there-a-risk-of-licences-changing-too-frequently-or-without-notice","text":"In any licensing model that is not explicitly time-bound, there is a risk that the Data Provider may choose to change the licence arbitrarily. We have received feedback that bespoke licensing in the energy sector already produces insecurity for Data Consumers , who are concerned about the longevity of particular licences in a changeable environment. For example, an energy forecasting company relies on predictable access to, and capabilities to use, a range of datasets (e.g. weather data). Changes to the capabilities granted for any of these datasets undermine this kind of business model, with additional proxy consequences for carbon savings that could be achieved as a result of better integration of renewable energy generation. Icebreaker One aims to address this problem by encouraging Data Providers to indicate the length of time they commit to retaining the same capability grant for a particular access rule. Although this will be optional, we hope that Data Providers will be incentivised to do so as this encourages confidence in the market. We are also exploring the possibility of building a notification system to alert Data Consumers either to upcoming or new changes in capability grants to ensure this is done transparently and with adequate warning where possible. NOTE : The time ranges described above are NOT a time limit on the capabilities granted in response to a single request, it instead specifies a range within which the access rules and their corresponding capability grants will not change. Beyond designing positive behavioural and market incentives, it is beyond the scope of the IB1 Trust Framework to control licence-changes as this remains within the legal rights of the Data Provider .","title":"Is there a risk of licences changing too frequently or without notice?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#where-are-these-rules-specified","text":"The access control, capability, and obligation grants form part of the metadata for a dataset.

Data Providers MUST ensure that access conditions and capability grants are non-discriminatory and fair to Data Consumers Data Providers SHOULD ensure that the validity time bounds of any published capability grants are sufficient for reasonable commercial operation of a data consumer Responsibility - Data provision Data Providers are responsible for providing a data API for each data set, and for configuring and securing each API in accordance with the kinds of data it exposes (along with any other access conditions deemed necessary and appropriate by the Data Provider on a per-data-set basis) Open data MUST be made available with no authentication or authorization requirements Shared data MUST made available through a FAPI compliant resource server connected to the TFGS \u2019s authorization service (see Common Security Requirements for more details) Data formats The IB1 Trust Framework does not define or mandate individual data formats to be returned from data APIs - the diversity of kinds of information in the sector renders this impractical, and the additional overhead imposed on data providers would be undesirable. With this said, we would encourage Data Providers to consider likely automated consumption of data when designing their data APIs - this implies using machine readable formats such as CSV , JSON and similar, with a preference for those formats compatible with existing software tools and libraries. Responsibility - Data integrity and correctness Data Providers are responsible for the correctness of data returned by their published data APIs . Open Net Zero provides a mechanism (a flag at the top-right of the page for the dataset) by which Data Consumers can report any data quality issues to Icebreaker One, which will be forwarded to a nominated contact within the Data Provider . Responsibility - Metadata provision Data Providers are responsible for creating, and publishing, metadata for each exposed data set. This provides visibility of each data set within the Trust Framework Governance Service ( TFGS ) Registry. The metadata file covers, for each provided data set, whether shared or open: Semantic content Access rules and licensing of the data set Transport mechanism specification Syntactic content The content and format of the metadata file can be found at Data Set Metadata . The Data Provider is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of this metadata. Responsibility - API availability Data Providers are responsible for availability of their published data APIs . Availability will be monitored automatically by the TFGS , availability information will form part of the metadata for each data set record in the TFGS Registry. The TFGS will provide a mechanism for Data Providers to announce scheduled downtime when planned, and to report unscheduled downtime when necessary. Responsibility - API stability and change management Data Providers are responsible for managing any change to the data APIs such that disruption to Data Consumers is minimised. This is handled through: Semantic versioning of all API methods Publication of anticipated changes and retirement of API versions through the TFGS Changeover periods where new and prior API versions are run in parallel Data API Requirements Unlike Open Banking, the IB1 Trust Framework does not mandate particular APIs for data provision - it is expected that there will be a variety of mechanisms to expose data, with varying inputs (from a single data set ID to a complex query object) and varying kinds of output dependent on the information exposed. With that said, there are certain properties that all data APIs must satisfy to interoperate successfully with other parties within the IB1 Trust Framework. We refer to endpoints used to retrieve data as data endpoints, and others as infrastructure endpoints. Date and time formats Whenever date or time quantities are accepted or returned from a data API , these values MUST conform to |RFC| 3339 . This is referenced elsewhere in this document as date/time Endpoint security Open data endpoints Data endpoints which provide access to open data (in class IB1-O ) MUST NOT require any form of authentication prior to access. This includes allowing access to entities which are not members of the IB1 Trust Framework. Shared data endpoints Data endpoints which provide access to shared data (in classes IB1-SA and IB1-SB ) MUST implement the subset of the resource server part of the FAPI specification used within the IB1 Trust Framework as described in Common Security Requirements , and authorize against the TFGS authorization service. Protected data endpoints MAY use the token introspection mechanism provided by FAPI to gather additional information about the client making the request prior to any access decision. Heartbeat and monitoring endpoint All data APIs SHOULD include a FAPI protected heartbeat infrastructure endpoint. This serves two purposes: It allows the TFGS to monitor the liveness of the data API It provides some level of verification that the resource server has been correctly configured The heartbeat endpoint location is defined within the data set metadata file, if specified it MUST respond to GET requests from the TFGS monitoring system with a 200 status code. If the heartbeat response contains a body, the body will be interpreted by the TFGS monitoring system as a JSON dictionary containing statistics for the period between the most recent two successful calls to the heartbeat endpoint (including the call to which this is a response). This response is RECOMMENDED as it provides oversight of API usage to the TFGS . Legal keys, and the semantics of their associated values, are as follows: Name Content period_start date/time of the start of the period for which statistics are reported period_end date/time of the end of the period for which statistics are reported, this will typically be the date and time of the heartbeat request api_call_response_[CODE]_count integer number of requests to non-heartbeat endpoints within this data API which resulted in a response of type CODE. A distinct key:value pair is sent in the response for each distinct HTTP status code returned. API documentation Data APIs MUST be described within the transport section of the data set metadata file. Versioning All data APIs MUST include a version number in the path of each data endpoint. This version SHOULD use semantic versioning to differentiate between breaking and backwards compatible changes. This MUST be documented within the OpenAPI transport section of the metadata file. Problem Resolution (Data Providers) Effective resolution of problems (Data Providers) A Data Provider MUST create documentation to clearly outline the policies, processes and systems it has in place for problem resolution and its respective service level objectives. This framework should enable the effective resolution of Data Consumer issues and therefore cater for problems that relate specifically to a Data Consumer \u2019s use of a Data Provider \u2019s data APIs . In the event that a Data Consumer is unable to resolve an issue with a Data Provider , the issue MAY be flagged to the TFGS Dispute Resolution function for independent support. Online support Data Providers SHOULD provide Frequently Asked Questions , which address areas that may be specific to Data Consumers such as technical advice or test facility guidance. They should also consider a means of identifying recurring questions or user-error issues so these can be collated into Frequently Asked Questions to support the early resolution of problems. Problem resolution documentation, Frequently Asked Questions , contact details, opening times and out of hours support SHOULD be published and easily accessible in one collective area on the Data Provider \u2019s website. Ticket management process Data Providers MUST ensure they have a functioning ticket management system which enables them to respond to issues and problems raised within clearly defined service level targets. A successful problem resolution framework will enable the efficient identification and resolution of problems which specifically impact Data Consumers . The system for raising and reporting on tickets should be transparent in order to fully inform users and engender trust across the ecosystem. Dispute resolution for access control and capability grant policies (Data Providers) In cases where a Data Consumer believes that access conditions or capability grant rules are being applied unfairly, the TFGS will act as a mediating party. TFGS support (Data Providers) The TFGS Service Desk will provide participants with a supplementary ticket management process and supports Data Providers in communicating problems to ecosystem participants via the noticeboard. Change Management This section outlines various change scenarios that may impact Data Consumers , and provides guidance for a Data Provider to consider when implementing a change and communicating to Data Consumers . Downtime Planned downtime, by definition, is something that a Data Provider anticipates and therefore is able to give advance notice to Data Consumers . It is not generally possible to give advance notice of unplanned downtime, but Data Providers should give notice as soon as they are aware of the downtime. When providing notifications, Data Providers SHOULD provide a specific time period, so Data Consumers are aware that the data API will be unavailable for that time, or upon a subsequent notification to confirm that the service has been reinstated sooner than anticipated. In future, TFGS Support Services will be able assist Data Providers with the dissemination of downtime information to the wider Icebreaker One ecosystem via its central noticeboard facility. Planned downtime should be given at least five business days before the event. Apart from cancelling the planned downtime, no changes should be made to the planned downtime notification within the five business day period. Where practical, Data Providers should give advance notice via their own website, developer portal or TFGS of any planned downtime one calendar month in advance. Licensing and access control changes Data Providers MUST provide advance notice of any changes to access control and capability grant policies. This is normally covered by the time-bounded nature of these grants, but Data Providers MAY also use any notification services provided by the TFGS to publish additional information about changes. Data API changes Data Providers may periodically wish to upgrade and / or to deprecate versions of their data APIs . The following mitigation measures will reduce the impact on service providers of these changes. Dual running and deprecation Data Providers SHOULD support a minimum of two non-compatible API versions in a production context, providing both versions were previously supported by the Data Provider , for a period of time long enough to ensure that Data Consumers have had sufficient time to successfully test the new version and migrate their applications and customers. TFGS recommends dual running for at least six months for a major version, and three months for a minor version. Where a Data Provider implements a data API for the first time, they will only need to support this one version to start with. The deprecation of unsupported versions is at the Data Provider \u2019s discretion \u2013 based on usage metrics. However, the TFGS may recommend that any specific version (major, minor, or patch) should be deprecated at any time, and this should be implemented within three months of notification by the TFGS . This is to cater for critical defects, especially those relating to security. In exceptional circumstances it may be agreed by TFGS that support for a specific version is terminated earlier. Data Providers must not apply any measures to induce Data Consumers to adopt a new version of the APIs (e.g. rate limiting the older version while providing better performance on a newer version). API credentials, consent and authorisation API Credentials associated with an API should be version agnostic. Therefore, a Data Consumer accessing v1.0, v1.1 or v2.0 should be able to use the same API Credentials across all available API endpoints.","title":"Guidance for Data Providers"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/data_provider_ops_guidelines/#guidance-for-data-providers","text":"NOTE : This document is primarily intended for technical and operations teams within organisations wishing to participate in the IB1 Trust Framework as Data Providers .

The guidelines are supplemented by links to more detailed technical and membership documentation. Overarching aims of these operational guidelines: To deliver a safe and effective Trust Framework ecosystem that meets the needs of members and supports the broader sector transition to Net Zero by enabling better discovery and sharing of data via a robust trust framework. To support the operational requirements of Data Providers and Data Consumers , stimulating an active data sharing ecosystem. This includes ensuring that all members understand the sensitivity classes, access, and licensing models for data shared in the ecosystem, and are incentivised towards transparency and interoperability. To ensure positive member experiences that demonstrate the Icebreaker Principles and encourage them to continue participating in the ecosystem. To minimise potential costs associated with insufficient API or other technical system testing, downtime, or other common faults. To reduce any reputational risks associated with individual members, incorrect application of core policies, or the Icebreaker One ecosystem as a whole. These guidelines are structured in six sections, outlining: Introduction (this section): background to the IB1 Trust Framework project, clarifications of the roles and responsibilities of different types of actors operating in the Trust Framework ecosystem. Glossary : definitions of common acronyms, terminology, and technical tools used in the Trust Framework documentation. Considerations Before You Start : \u2018at a glance\u2019 list of items that all types of new members will need to consider in order to meet operational requirements. Core Policies : operational principles and policies central to Trust Framework function. Includes policies governing data sensitivity classification, access controls, and licensing. Guidance for Data Consumers and Guidance for Data Providers : guidelines outlining how Data Providers can share data safely and securely via the Trust Framework while retaining strong control, provide appropriate and timely metadata, and design safe and effective APIs enabling data-sharing. Guidelines outlining how Data Consumers can meet the requirements for offering data services, access and licensing conditions for different data classes, and best practice with regards to testing, security, ethics and dispute management. Additional Material : links to other relevant documentation (e.g. technical, legal, etc.) sitting outside the operational guidelines. Disclaimer : The contents of the Operational Guidelines do not constitute legal advice. While they have been drafted with regard to relevant regulatory provisions and best practice, they are not a complete list of the regulatory or legal obligations that apply to members and users of the IB1 Trust Framework. Although intended to be consistent with relevant regulations and laws, in the event of any conflict, those regulations and laws will take priority. Participants are responsible for their own compliance with all applicable regulations and laws, including but not limited to: data protection and privacy, consumer protection laws, and energy sector licences and codes (where applicable). The IB1 Trust Framework operational guidelines will be revised in future in accordance with further development of services offered in the ecosystem, or changes to the regulatory and policy environment in which it operates. Please ensure that you are referring to the most current version of the guidelines prior to reading. What is the Icebreaker One Trust Framework, how was it made and who is it for? The Icebreaker One (IB1) Trust Framework is an ambitious, non-profit project working with across industry, finance, government and regulators to modernise access to data and break down barriers to data sharing. The Trust Framework makes it easier to discover, share, access and use datasets, supporting the drive towards decarbonisation and its related social and economic benefits. The Trust Framework is a generalisation of the Open Energy project, which received initial development funding from the Modernising Energy Data Access competition, backed by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ( BEIS ), and Innovate UK . Open Energy in turn built on learning from Open Banking - identifying which elements are transferable to the energy sector, and which require adaptation or fresh thinking. Throughout this process, the Icebreaker One team has engaged in extensive consultation with all sectors involved, in order to ensure that the project meets the widest possible variety of needs. The ethos of the IB1 Trust Framework will remain grounded in sector engagement and a collaborative approach as the project moves forward. The IB1 Trust Framework aims to serve all actors across sectors who are looking to share data, access data, or both. Membership is open to a wide range of organisations - from large corporations through to charities, researchers, or community groups. Both Open : and Shared Data can flow within the Trust Framework. How is the IB1 Trust Framework Structured? The IB1 Trust Framework consists of two core functions: dataset search and discovery, and the Trust Framework Governance Service (TFGS). These functions are described below. Dataset Search The IB1 Trust Framework\u2019s first core function - Open Net Zero - enables dataset search and discovery. Open Net Zero empowers users to find out what datasets exist and who owns/controls them. Search results also outline the sensitivity class , access rules , and capability grants associated with a certain dataset, meaning that access and licensing details are transparent. This works through a search engine designed specifically to search for datasets, with options to search by different parameters in order to refine results. It can also be used to discover datasets adjacent to searches; helping users to build up a more rounded picture of the net-zero data landscape in their sphere of interest. Open Net Zero is free, available to all, and will remain so. Access pathways to Open and Shared data are described in the following section. Datasets provided by IB1 Trust Framework members ( Data Providers ) and non-Trust Framework members (e.g. web scraped Open Data) may both be visible in Open Net Zero. Datasets provided by an IB1 Trust Framework member will be marked with a badge to indicate that the provenance of the dataset has been verified, uptime is monitored, documentation format is known, and users have a mechanism to provide feedback on the dataset if issues are detected. (Please note that this does not indicate that Icebreaker One has carried out further, more extensive checks on data quality within members\u2019 datasets.) Governance Service The second core function - the Trust Framework Governance Service ( TFGS ) - supports members to provide, share and access different classes of Shared data (see Data Sensitivity Classes ) on the basis of preemptive licensing (see Data Licensing ). Shared Data accessed via the TFGS will be provided by Trust Framework members only ( Data Providers ). The Governance Service aims to provide a secure, trusted mechanism to improve data sharing across the sector by reducing the time and financial costs currently associated with accessing Shared data. For providers of Shared data, the Governance Service offers a secure and effective way to list datasets and set appropriate access and licensing requirements. For actors wishing to access Shared data, the Governance Service provides a mechanism to reduce friction and bilateral contract negotiation, even when requesting access to multiple datasets from different providers. Project Governance The IB1 Trust Framework, and Trust Frameworks that build upon it, have a Steering Group (SG) and five Advisory Groups (AGs). The latter may be combined into fewer groups that together cover the function of the five AGs. Steering Group Provide governance, strategic and tactical leadership, and oversee market-wide communications. Appoint and direct Advisory Groups. Discuss, review and ratify plans. User Needs, Materiality, Impact Advisory Group Explore, prioritise and work through use cases (identifying users, their needs, mapping the data value chain). Agree data needs that represent materiality of the challenge area that can be linked to market impact . Develop the business, value and impact cases for the programme and its impact on policy targets, businesses and financial instruments. Where relevant, identify relevant net zero reporting standards and frameworks. Technical infrastructure Advisory Group Agree technical data and metadata standards for publishing data, including machine-readable standards and data access (e.g. APIs). Operational technical systems that enable data sharing (trust framework) and processing (e.g. calculation). Data Licensing & Legal Develop standard legal data licences that allow restricted data to flow securely across the market, with consent, in alignment with Data Sensitivity Classes . This includes key policies, such as conditions for participation, roles and responsibilities. Outputs of this group address the necessary licences and requirements for a functioning access control. Engagement & Communications Convene and bring people together to ensure common understanding of what is being done, why and how. Address the user experience (whether business or consumer), signposting and addressing how to inspire behavioural change. Create awareness , engagement and impact with stakeholders. Policy Address potential policy interventions. From a business perspective, this may include potential for corporate policy or changes in procurement. From a government perspective, this may include policy, regulatory or code-based interventions. Group makeup The membership of these groups is designed to represent a range of different types of organisations, and broader digital sector where relevant. Icebreaker One members can apply to join the Advisory and Steering Groups. However, membership of these groups will not be restricted to members only and non-members may be invited to join in order to balance representation. If you are interested in participating in future Icebreaker One governance mechanisms please contact info@icebreakerone.org TODO check this email. What data can be found and used through Open Net Zero? Open Net Zero supports both Open and Shared datasets. Different classes of data, assessed by their levels of sensitivity, are described in Data Sensitivity Classes . Open data Open data is defined as: \u2018Data that anyone can use, for any purpose, for free and is accessible under an Open data licence\u2019. Examples of open datasets include (non-exhaustive): Lower Super Output Layer ID ( LSOA ) data, Digest of UK Energy Statistics, and OpenStreetMap data. Open data is visible via Open Net Zero, which is free and open to all users. Open datasets provided by IB1 Trust Framework members ( Data Providers ) and non-IB1 Trust Framework members will both be visible. There are no barriers to accessing Open data once it is discovered - users are directed to an appropriate URL or API to access the data themselves. Open data access is not moderated via the TFGS as no additional access controls are required. Shared data Shared data is defined as: \u2018Data that is neither open nor closed, but can be shared under specific terms and conditions.\u2019 Examples of datasets currently licensed as Shared data include (non-exhaustive): primary substation capacity, network outage data, weather predictions, European space agency data, Electralink daily smart meter installations, certain geolocation information for energy assets and building typologies. As illustrated in these examples, Shared data is extremely diverse and can include datasets with a range of different commercial, personal and security sensitivity levels. To provide nuance in this area, Icebreaker One consultations have established a set of five data sensitivity classes, in which three classes describe separate categories of Shared data. Due to the sheer diversity of data types, the IB1 Trust Framework does not yet cover all Sensitivity Classes. At present, the TFGS can facilitate the sharing of non-personal Shared data classes only. This means that currently, sharing of non-aggregated personal data (including datasets using forms of anonymisation other than aggregation conforming to ICO / ONS best practice) is not permitted in the IB1 Trust Framework. Functionality to share personal data (class IB1-SP ), and data that has been anonymised using techniques other than aggregation, are planned for the future subject to further consultation. The metadata and sensitivity class of Shared datasets are listed on Open Net Zero and are visible to any user. Shared datasets provided by IB1 Trust Framework members ( Data Providers ) and non-members are both visible (where the latter are known), as described later in this section. Access to Shared datasets provided by IB1 Trust Framework members is moderated through the TFGS , on the basis of preemptive licensing. Access to Shared data listed on the Search that is not provided by an IB1 Trust Framework member is not supported - users should contact the non-member organisation directly to arrange access. Closed data Closed data is defined as: \u2018Data that either cannot be shared or requires a per-use, custom licence negotiated on a case-by-case basis\u2019. Under our current model, closed data is never suitable to share within the IB1 Trust Framework and is not visible through Open Net Zero. While we acknowledge industry feedback flagging potential value in using Open Net Zero infrastructure to privately share Closed data not listed in the Search or TFGS Directory, this is not a focus of project development at this time. Any extensibility of this function in future will be subject to consultation. What role does your organisation play in the IB1 Trust Framework? Members of the Trust Framework have different roles: Data Providers , Data Consumers , or both. This section outlines the meaning of the different roles and outlines their basic responsibilities. Data Providers Data Providers are organisations that control datasets that they wish to make visible and/or accessible through the IB1 Trust Framework. Data Providers can provide Open and/or Shared datasets. Data Providers are responsible for: data sensitivity classification, creation of access rules, creation of capability grants, data provision, data integrity and correctness, metadata provision, and API availability, stability and change management. Full guidance regarding Data Provider responsibilities can be found in Guidance for Data Providers . Data Consumers Data Consumers are organisations that seek to find and access datasets through the Trust Framework Governance Service (TFGS). Data Consumers can be established to serve internal organisational needs, to serve external customers, or both. Data Consumers is a catch-all term referring to all parties accessing data via the OEGS . Full guidance can be found in Guidance for Data Consumers Service Providers Data Consumers who access data to serve external customers, potentially including customers outside the IB1 Trust Framework, are categorised as a specific type of Data Consumer called a Service Provider . See Data Consumer vs Service Provider . Dual Roles Organisations wishing to both provide and access data through the IB1 Trust Framework are able to do so, so long as they fulfill the responsibilities of both roles. Data Providers who do not want to register as Data Consumers , but who wish to access IB1 Trust Framework datasets, are able to do so by using the services of a Service Provider (a type of Data Consumer in the IB1 Trust Framework that provides services to customers, potentially including non-Trust Framework members). How does dataset access and licensing operate under the Trust Framework? Icebreaker One has consulted publicly and with industry on policies pertaining to: the types of conditions on which data access controls can be based, the process by which Data Providers establish access rules for a dataset, and the model for associating access rules with the grant of particular capabilities and obligations (licensing model). These policies are outlined briefly below, and set out in full detail in Section 3 of the Operational Guidelines. Types of Access Conditions The IB1 Trust Framework defines a set of conditions which may be specified for Data Consumers to meet in order to gain access to datasets in different sensitivity classes. These include, but are not limited to: payment, security compliance, regulatory compliance, standards compliance, group-based access, and use case-based access. Creating Access Rules (Introduction) To operationalise Data Access conditions above, the Trust Framework defines a system whereby access grants are determined, for each request to the API of a Data Provider , on the basis of a set of rules defined and published by that Data Provider in the dataset metadata. Data Licensing (Introduction) A data licence is a legal instrument setting out what a Data Consumer can do with a particular artefact (e.g. dataset). This grants certain \u2018capabilities\u2019 to the Data Consumer , comprising a clear expression of things they can do with the artefact. Capability grants are accompanied by any obligations that the Data Consumer must abide by when exercising a capability. The capabilities and obligations associated with each API call will be converted into a licence through the Trust Framework Governance Service ( TFGS ). The IB1 Trust Framework operates through a range of standardised capability grants and obligations. Standardisation includes legal text, \u2018human readable\u2019 text and summary notation. Data Providers must specify which capabilities and obligations are associated with each access rule, and publish this transparently in the dataset metadata. Future development of the guidelines The guidelines are designed as an iterative document that will develop in accordance with future phases of the IB1 Trust Framework.

The guidelines are supplemented by links to more detailed technical and membership documentation. Overarching aims of these operational guidelines: To deliver a safe and effective Trust Framework ecosystem that meets the needs of members and supports the broader sector transition to Net Zero by enabling better discovery and sharing of data via a robust trust framework. To support the operational requirements of Data Providers and Data Consumers , stimulating an active data sharing ecosystem. This includes ensuring that all members understand the sensitivity classes, access, and licensing models for data shared in the ecosystem, and are incentivised towards transparency and interoperability. To ensure positive member experiences that demonstrate the Icebreaker Principles and encourage them to continue participating in the ecosystem. To minimise potential costs associated with insufficient API or other technical system testing, downtime, or other common faults. To reduce any reputational risks associated with individual members, incorrect application of core policies, or the Icebreaker One ecosystem as a whole. These guidelines are structured in six sections, outlining: Introduction (this section): background to the IB1 Trust Framework project, clarifications of the roles and responsibilities of different types of actors operating in the Trust Framework ecosystem. Glossary : definitions of common acronyms, terminology, and technical tools used in the Trust Framework documentation. Considerations Before You Start : \u2018at a glance\u2019 list of items that all types of new members will need to consider in order to meet operational requirements. Core Policies : operational principles and policies central to Trust Framework function. Includes policies governing data sensitivity classification, access controls, and licensing. Guidance for Data Consumers and Guidance for Data Providers : guidelines outlining how Data Providers can share data safely and securely via the Trust Framework while retaining strong control, provide appropriate and timely metadata, and design safe and effective APIs enabling data-sharing. Guidelines outlining how Data Consumers can meet the requirements for offering data services, access and licensing conditions for different data classes, and best practice with regards to testing, security, ethics and dispute management. Additional Material : links to other relevant documentation (e.g. technical, legal, etc.) sitting outside the operational guidelines. Disclaimer : The contents of the Operational Guidelines do not constitute legal advice. While they have been drafted with regard to relevant regulatory provisions and best practice, they are not a complete list of the regulatory or legal obligations that apply to members and users of the IB1 Trust Framework. Although intended to be consistent with relevant regulations and laws, in the event of any conflict, those regulations and laws will take priority. Participants are responsible for their own compliance with all applicable regulations and laws, including but not limited to: data protection and privacy, consumer protection laws, and energy sector licences and codes (where applicable).

The Trust Framework makes it easier to discover, share, access and use datasets, supporting the drive towards decarbonisation and its related social and economic benefits. The Trust Framework is a generalisation of the Open Energy project, which received initial development funding from the Modernising Energy Data Access competition, backed by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ( BEIS ), and Innovate UK . Open Energy in turn built on learning from Open Banking - identifying which elements are transferable to the energy sector, and which require adaptation or fresh thinking. Throughout this process, the Icebreaker One team has engaged in extensive consultation with all sectors involved, in order to ensure that the project meets the widest possible variety of needs. The ethos of the IB1 Trust Framework will remain grounded in sector engagement and a collaborative approach as the project moves forward. The IB1 Trust Framework aims to serve all actors across sectors who are looking to share data, access data, or both. Membership is open to a wide range of organisations - from large corporations through to charities, researchers, or community groups.

Open Net Zero empowers users to find out what datasets exist and who owns/controls them.

This works through a search engine designed specifically to search for datasets, with options to search by different parameters in order to refine results. It can also be used to discover datasets adjacent to searches; helping users to build up a more rounded picture of the net-zero data landscape in their sphere of interest. Open Net Zero is free, available to all, and will remain so. Access pathways to Open and Shared data are described in the following section. Datasets provided by IB1 Trust Framework members ( Data Providers ) and non-Trust Framework members (e.g. web scraped Open Data) may both be visible in Open Net Zero. Datasets provided by an IB1 Trust Framework member will be marked with a badge to indicate that the provenance of the dataset has been verified, uptime is monitored, documentation format is known, and users have a mechanism to provide feedback on the dataset if issues are detected.

The Governance Service aims to provide a secure, trusted mechanism to improve data sharing across the sector by reducing the time and financial costs currently associated with accessing Shared data.

The Icebreaker One (IB1) Trust Framework defines a security and trust model for shared data APIs . Three parties are involved in each shared data request: The Data Consumer wishing to access the shared data API The authorization server, as part of the governance service ( TFGS ), with knowledge about the Data Consumer as represented by an organisation account within the TFGS The Data Provider responsible for supplying shared data through its shared data API The interactions are shown graphically below in the form of a sequence diagram. Applicable standards We use a strict sub-set of the FAPI specification for interactions between Data Providers and Data Consumers . The applicable standards are linked here for reference, we reference the precise elements of these standards in later sections. RFC6749 The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework RFC6750 The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage OpenID Connect Core 1.0 RFC8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens Discovery of endpoint URLs While not strictly necessary, the authorization server deployed as part of the TFGS implements the OpenID Connect Discovery provider configuration information endpoint as described here , references in this document to e.g. token_endpoint refer to properties discoverable in this fashion. Token acquisition In order to access a shared data API , a Data Consumer must first acquire an access token. This is done by sending an HTTP request to the authorization server (part of the TFGS ). The Data Consumer MUST : Use MTLS , presenting a client certificate when requested. This is the tls_client_auth authentication method described in section 2 of RFC8705 . In our implementation, this certificate is acquired by creating a transport certificate in a software statement within the TFGS directory Use the client_credentials grant type Send a POST request to the token_endpoint of the authorization server containing the following properties as application/x-www-form-urlencoded key / value pairs: client_id : <CLIENT_ID> scope: <REQUESTED_SCOPES> grant_type: client_credentials Scope may be omitted, for most uses within the IB1 Trust Framework there is no requirement to specify a scope. CLIENT_ID can be obtained from the software statement within the directory corresponding to this client. A successful call to the token_endpoint is indicated by a 200 response code, in which case the body of the response will contain a JSON object with at least two properties: access_token is an opaque string to be used as a bearer token for requests to resource servers (a Data Consumer shared data API in our context) expires_in is an integer number of seconds from the current time, after which the token will no longer be valid after this point the Data Consumer MUST request a new token in order to continue to access shared data resources Token usage - calling a shared data API To call a shared data API within a Data Provider , the Data Consumer MUST: Use MTLS as previously described Pass the previously acquired bearer token in an HTTP header: Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> In addition, the Data Consumer SHOULD : Specify an interaction ID for this call in an HTTP header: x-fapi-interaction-id: <UUID> This allows for tracking of transactions between clients and resource servers, aiding troubleshooting. We use a UUID4 in our reference implementation Request validation To participate in the IB1 Trust Framework, a Data Provider MUST : Expose an HTTPS API Perform validation on any requests to this API Reject any requests which do not present a valid client certificate. Client certificates are validated in the context of the root CAs provided by the TFGS directory. Reject any requests which do not provide an Authorization header containing a Bearer token as described above If any of the above checks fail, the Data Provider MUST NOT continue processing the request, and SHOULD respond with an error response as defined in this section of RFC6750 Token introspection If all the above checks pass, the Data Provider MUST then validate the presented token. Tokens in our case are opaque identifiers (as opposed to JWTs) and must be passed to the introspection_endpoint of the authorization server to obtain additional information. To obtain this introspection response, the Data Provider MUST : Make a POST request to the introspection_endpoint of the authorization server Use MTLS , this means Data Providers must also have a provisioned client within the TFGS directory in the form of a software statement and corresponding transport certificate Send the bearer token and client ID of the Data Provider as an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body with the following values: token: <BEARER_TOKEN> client_id: <CLIENT_ID> Introspection response validation The response body of this introspection call contains a JSON object with information about the entity which requested the supplied token from the authorization server, as well as properties of the token itself. An example introspection response is shown below: { \"active\": true, \"organisation_id\": \"8\", \"organisation_name\": \"A Demo Provider\", \"organisation_number\": \"8\", \"software_roles\": [ \"EDSP_L1\" ], \"software_description\": \"Description: https://www.demo.org.uk/ is the location of our demo server\", \"additional_software_metadata\": { \"metadata\": { \"something\": \"something else\" } }, \"client_id\": \"kZuAsn7UyZ98Wwh29hDpf\", \"exp\": 1626279245, \"iat\": 1626278645, \"iss\": \"https://auth.directory.sandbox.trust.icebreakerone.org\", \"scope\": \"directory:software\", \"cnf\": { \"x5t#S256\": \"rP_-9u3ZyVo4ryQxg-bn4rr6gJGNu1dTowEeppOuIt8\" }, \"token_type\": \"Bearer\" } The following elements of the introspection response MUST be validated further before any Trust Framework-specific processing is performed: active If the introspection response does not contain the key active , or the value of this key is anything other than the boolean true value, the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease further processing. If the active key was not present, it SHOULD respond with 400 invalid_request If the active key was present but not true it SHOULD respond with 401 invalid_token time ranges If the introspection response contains iat this is interpreted as a number of seconds since the epoch at which the token was issued. If this is in the future the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease further processing. It SHOULD respond with a 401 invalid_token . NOTE : The Data Provider SHOULD allow for a reasonable degree of clock skew when interpreting the iat timestamp, an allowance of no more than 10 seconds should cover all reasonable cases. If the introspection response contains exp this is interpreted as a number of seconds since the epoch after which the token should be considered invalid. If this is in the past, the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease further processing. It SHOULD respond with a 401 invalid_token certificate thumbprint The IB1 Trust Framework uses certificate pinning combined with MTLS on all requests between Data Consumers and Data Providers . This ensures that a token issued to one client cannot be re-used by another client. Data Providers MUST check that the thumbprint of the presented client certificate matches that provided within the introspection response. The introspection response contains the SHA256 thumbprint of the certificate used to acquire the token as a nested property ['cnf']['x5t#S256'] . This MUST be equal to the SHA256 thumbprint of the client certificate, if this is not the case the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease any further processing, responding with a 401 invalid_token Interaction header If the x-fapi-interaction-id header is set in the request, it MUST be set to the same value in the response header of the same name. If not set, a new ID MUST be generated and set in the response header. Other validation If all the above checks have passed, the Data Provider can service the request and return whatever data were requested. It MAY , however, apply additional checks based on information in the introspection response about the client. This is where any IB1 Trust Framework specific access control and licensing policies are applied. To inform any additional processing, the Data Provider MAY make use of the ['additional_client_metadata']['metadata'] key within the introspection response. This contains a JSON object with properties asserted about the Data Consumer . The exact set of properties is not defined here, please see the access control language specification for more information about what could be specified. Data Providers MAY make use of the organisation_id field in the token introspection response to uniquely and consistently identify the organisation of the Data Consumer where required, for example to reference a customer record within the Data Provider .
