An access rule contains: Zero or more conditions for access One or more capability grants to the data consumer if access is granted Zero or more obligations falling on the data consumer if access is granted They are applied to properties of a Data Consumer while processing a request for data from a Data Provider . These properties can be modelled as a map of names to values; some values may be inferred by joining on the ID of the data consumer, some may be directly provided in the Token introspection response. Syntax Names Names consist of a namespace ( [a-z0-9_]+ ), a : character, and a suffix ( [a-z0-9_.]+ ). For example, oe:some_value . Values asserted by Open Energy will always have a namespace oe . The suffix may contain . characters, the namespace may not. Rule syntax An access rule is represented as a single line string containing a comma separated list of zero or more Conditions, the literal string grants , and then a comma separated list of one or more Capabilities. Optionally, this may be followed by the literal requires and one or more Obligations in a comma separated list. [CONDITION]? [\",\" CONDITION]* \"grants\" CAPABILITY [\",\" CAPABILITY]* [\"requires\" OBLIGATION+ [\",\" OBLIGATION] NOTE : * A rule with no conditions is valid, and is satisfied by all requests * All rules must grant at least one capability * Rules may have zero or more obligations See the following sections for specification of conditions and capabilities. Conditions Conditions are unary or binary clauses. All conditions must be satisfied within a rule for that rule to be applied. There are no explicit boolean operators such as or or similar. For cases where alternative sets of rules could be applied the expectation is that data providers will specify multiple, potentially overlapping, rules to express this. Unary clauses Unary clauses consist of a single named condition. The clause is satisfied if that condition is true . This is typically used to denote a particular property such as Open Energy current membership or similar where the existence of the property is sufficient to accept the data consumer. {\"oe:member\" : true} Binary clauses Binary clauses consist of a name on the left hand side, an operator , and a value on the right hand side. The valid operators are shown in the table below. LHS, operator, and RHS are separated with at least one space character. Values can be numerals, dates, quoted strings, or homogeneous lists of these three types. Dates are specified as dd/mm/yyyy , we do not need a higher level of precision in any of our envisaged use cases, but if this is needed a datetime must be specified as a string compliant with RFC3339 . To simplify expression in JSON , quoted strings should be enclosed in single quote ' characters. Lists are written as a comma separated list of strings surrounded by [ and ] characters. Lists are only valid RHS values for the in operator. Operators Operator Range Description is Any The condition passes if the value of the property on the LHS is exactly equal to the value in the RHS before date or datetime The condition passes if the value of the property on the LHS is before the date or datetime specifed as the RHS. Where a date needs to be coerced to a datetime, it is done by setting it to 00:00.00 with the same date after date or datetime As above, but passes if the value of the property on the LHS is after the date or datetime specified on the RHS. max_age_days date or datetime The condition passes if the value on the LHS corresponds to a date at most X days in the past compared to the current date, where X is integer numeral specified as the RHS < , <= , >= , > , == number Conditions pass if the LHS is, respectively, less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal, greater than, or strictly equal, to the number on the RHS. Note that == and is are equivalent for numeric quantities in number or string Conditions pass if there is at least one item in the list specified in the RHS which would match the is condition with respect to the LHS value Example conditions NOTE : The conditions shown below are examples, and should not be taken as indicative of standard properties of data consumers in the final system. Example condition clauses Condition Interpretation oe:status is 'active' passes if the value of oe:status is set, and is equal under string comparison to active oe:membership_expires after 24/10/2022 passes if the value of oe:membership_expires is either a date or a datetime, and is after the 24th October 2022 oe:terms_signed max_age_days 20 passes if the value of oe:terms_signed is either a date or a datetime, and is at most 20 days from the current datetime. Note that dates with no time component are equivalent to 00:00.00 on the specified date for comparison purposes some_group:membership_level >= 2 passes if the value of some_group:membership_level is a number and is greater to or equal to two. oe:org_type in ['council', 'academic'] passes if the value of oe:org_type would be considered equal to either 'council' or 'academic' as if compared with is . oe:member passes if the value of oe:member is true . Specifying multiple conditions Multiple conditions are separated with , characters. All conditions must be satisfied for the rule to pass, there are no sub-clauses or boolean operators. Any number of space characters are allowed before and after the , in a condition list. For example, oe:status is 'active', some_group:membership_level >=2 is the union of those two example conditions from the previous section and will only be satisfied if both conditions are individually satisfiable. Capabilities Capability grants for a given set of access conditions are specified as a comma ( , ) separated list of names . There MUST be at least one name in this list, an empty capability grant list is not considered valid. Standard capabilities These are capabilities where the namespace part of the name is oe , indicating that they are defined as part of the open energy project. Data providers SHOULD NOT , create their own capabilities unless absolutely necessary as doing so acts against the aim of easy interoperability and comprehension of access and licensing rules. Any additional capabilities designed MUST be prefixed with the organisation ID of the data provider responsible for their definition, and any such data provider MUST publish a clear, legally valid, definition of any such capabilities. In addition, data providers creating custom capabilities MUST inform the OEGS of this, providing links to the aforementioned documentation. WARNING : This section is provisional, the exact final set of base capabilities has yet to be determined. Those shown below are a plausible first cut but should not be considered definitive.

An open data set by definition has no access conditions, so any access rules for such data sets MUST have an empty access condition list, and must use one of the following capabilities to declare that the data are licensed under a known OSI approved open license Rules MUST NOT grant a mix of capabilities in the open namespace and capabilities in other namespaces, as the semantics of this are not well defined.

It is responsible for linking smart meters in homes and small businesses with the systems of energy suppliers, network operators and other companies.' www.ofgem.gov.uk: 126045 Distribution Network Operator DNO - Responsible for regional electricity distribution (lower voltage). Distribution System Operator DSO - In the UK, electricity DNOs are transitioning to become DSOs in response to electricity system changes (e.g. decentralisation, decarbonisation). The transition will change DNO responsibilities, broadening these from asset/network management. The term DSO is also commonly used outside of the UK. Electricity System Operator ESO - Responsible for system operation and balancing. National 'control room'. Role carried out by National Grid ESO (a separate company within the National Grid Group - not connected to the electricity TSO). Gas Distribution Network GDN - Responsible for regional gas distribution (lower pressure). Gas System Operator GSO - Responsible for system operation and balancing. National 'control room'. Role carried out by National Grid Gas Plc (a separate company within the National Grid Group who also own the gas transmission network). Independent Distribution Network Operator iDNO - IDNOs own and operate smaller networks located within the areas covered by the DNOs. IDNO networks are mainly extensions to the DNO networks serving new housing and commercial developments. www.ofgem.gov.uk: independent-distribution-network-operators Independent System Operator ISO - There is currently a proposal, backed by Ofgem, to convert the ESO to an ISO. The proposal advocates this change in order to meet new requirements of system operation oriented towards achieving Net Zero. The change would involve some change in the ESO's structure, responsibilities and relationship to other bodies in the sector.

Microgeneration Forms of small-scale generation (e.g. solar PV) that can be installed on domestic properties or small organisations (e.g. community centre) Multi-directional flow The flow of electricity in multiple directions within a network, due to the increased adoption of flexibility technologies and distributed generation (leading to mixed consumption/export). Big contrast to traditional grid operation built around linear electricity flows. Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading Energy trading directly between users/consumers, removing the 'middle man'. Not currently permitted in the UK due to regulatory arrangements regarding the 'supplier hub model' and single supplier. Relational data model A specific model for database management, used to construct relational databases. Semantic data model A high-level visual-conceptual tool used to define and describe data in the context of its relationships with other data. Smart meter A type of electricity and gas meter installed in domestic or SME properties that feeds information regarding energy consumption back to the consumer.

Data sets in class OE-O must expose an API with no extra security measures, and those in OE-SA and OE-SB must be secured by FAPI using the Open Energy trust services. Heartbeat URL Data providers SHOULD create a secured endpoint to act as a heartbeat - if this is specifed then the OEGS will periodically call it to assertain liveness and optionally gather metrics as described in Heartbeat and monitoring endpoint A hearbeat URL can be specified as a single key heartbeat_url with the value being the fully qualified URL at which the hearbeat response is exposed. Representation Block This section describes the format of any data received by a data consumer from this data set. Open Energy does not mandate particular formats, so this section is guidance rather than specification. The only required element in this section is a key mime which should contain the media type of the returned data. At a bare minimum this allows a client to load data into some kind of tooling. Depending on this value, other objects may be present. text/csv This type indicates that data is presented in CSV format. In this case, an optional key csvw may be defined, and should contain valid JSON-LD following the CSV for the Web guidelines: representation: mime: text/csv csvw: # This is only applicable if the mime type is text/csv \"@context\": http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw tableSchema: columns: - titles: country - titles: country group - titles: name (en) - titles: name (fr) - titles: name (de) - titles: latitude - titles: longitude Other types This is currently open for consultation, we would like to be able to guide data providers towards particular representation types for particular kinds of information, and make use of any existing ontologies or standards such as the Common Information Model where such standards will aid interoperability between Open Energy participants and the wider community.

Commercial","title":"Considerations for Data Consumers"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/","text":"Core Policies Introduction (Core Policies) This section aims to outline core policies and principles with implications for all members of the Open Energy ecosystem. Please note that it is beyond the scope of Open Energy Phase 3 to produce detailed guidance and tooling accompanying all policies in this section. Development of these resources is a priority for future development and will be approached openly; using consultation with Advisory Groups , tester organisations and members to ensure that resources meet member needs. All terminology used in this section is outlined in the Open Energy Glossary . Metadata Data sets are described by Data Providers through metadata files. The format for these can be found at Data Set Metadata Data Sensitivity Classes The Open Energy ecosystem incorporates a range of categories of data that have varied levels of sensitivity. In order to handle this complexity, and to ensure data is appropriately protected, Open Energy has developed a system of data sensitivity classification. In Open Energy Phase 2 (September - December 2020), the Policy and Membership Advisory Group established that a system of data classes should be used to distinguish data of different sensitivities shared within the Open Energy ecosystem. This policy builds from Phase 2 foundations and has been created with input from the Open Energy Advisory Groups, Review Track, and public consultation responses. Policy details Open Energy operates a system of five data sensitivity classes, graded across three dimensions of sensitivity: personal, commercial, and security. Personal sensitivity considers data defined as \u2018personal data\u2019 by the UK DPA 2018, and related privacy and consumer protection implications. Commercial sensitivity considers intellectual property, risk and commerciality. Security sensitivity includes critical national infrastructure and cybersecurity. Classes are presented in the table below. A definition, specification and dataset examples for each class will be provided in the Open Energy Operational Guidelines. Data Providers will then assess their datasets using the Operational Guidelines and allocate them to a class, prior to sharing them via the Open Energy ecosystem. Open Energy data classes are designed to supplement, not replace, the Modernising Energy Data Best Practice Guidance (Point 12) determining whether data should be made Open, Shared or Closed. In particular, Open Energy data classes are designed to provide further nuance to the category of Shared data - identifying three different classes in this space, with different sensitivity profiles. Detailed guidance and tooling, designed to support Data Providers to classify datasets consistently and fairly, will be inserted in due course beyond Phase 3. This will follow processes of consultation with Advisory Groups and tester organisations. data sensitivity classes in the Open Energy ecosystem Data Class Description Example Datasets Personal Sensitivity Commercial Sensitivity Security Sensitivity OE-C Closed data - limited to internal organisational access only or limited, bespoke bilateral contracts under specific circumstances. May be subject to hard legal barriers to sharing. May be security-critical information relating to operational technology supporting critical national infrastructure owned by an Operator of Essential Services. Never suitable to share within the OE ecosystem. Business-critical proprietary information or IP, critical asset locations, classified information. Very High Very High Very High OE-SP Datasets which include personal data, requiring appropriate consent to share, or other legal bases to data processing, as defined by the EU GDPR and brought into UK law via the DPA 2018. Currently not suitable to share within the |OE| ecosystem, with future extensibility subject to consultation. Smart meter data, home temperature preferences, protected characteristics or special category data (e.g. dependence on power due to health conditions), individual Electric vehicle charging records, transaction data. Very High Medium / High Medium / High OE-SB Datasets which do not include personal data and which can/could be shared, but currently require bilateral contract negotiation.

Data access refers to determining what types of conditions may be specified for |DCs| to meet in order to gain access to datasets in different sensitivity classes, and how access rules are articulated. This policy has been created with input from the Open Energy Advisory Groups, Review Track, and public consultation responses. The Open Energy Governance Service ( OEGS ) is responsible for providing Data Providers with verified information about Data Consumers , in line with specified access conditions for each dataset. However, the Data Provider is solely responsible for determining whether any given API request should be honoured (i.e. data access granted), and the licensing terms for any data returned in response to that request. This is due to requirements for control to rest with the Data Provider only. It is expected that Data Providers will grant access reliably and fairly, in line with the access conditions that they specify. In the event that access is refused, there will be a mechanism for flagging this with the OEGS for review and dispute management. Data Providers must be able to show clear justification for access refusal. Repeat refusal or non-compliance with specified access conditions may result in penalties (to be determined after Phase 3). This policy focuses on access conditions for classes OE-SA and OE-SB only. Personal data ( OE-SP ) are out of scope for development during Phase 3. Future extensibility of the Open Energy ecosystem to OE-SP data will be consulted on in future phases of project development. Policy details (Data access conditions) Data Providers will allocate each of their datasets to a sensitivity class prior to sharing them within the Open Energy ecosystem. Data access conditions will then be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the sensitivity profile of each class. We propose to use the data sensitivity classes previously established as a basis for considering access conditions, but not as a complete determinant. Our approach must serve the goal of reducing friction in sharing energy data, while also balancing two distinct sets of needs: Data Providers : to retain control over their data. Data Consumers and Service Providers : to access multiple datasets in a clear and manageable way. As such, we define a standardised range of access condition types as a mechanism to balance the factors outlined above. This acknowledges the need for more nuance than would be captured under a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach for each sensitivity class. Instead, our policy enables some tailoring within defined parameters. The table below describes access conditions for each of the Open Energy data sensitivity classes. It also demonstrates the rationale for this guidance - identifying the lack of standardised access conditions for OE-SA and OE-SB datasets as a cause of cost and friction in energy data sharing. Data sensitivity classes and access conditions in scope Data Class Access Conditions OE-C Determined and governed by the Data Provider only. OE-SP Currently determined by legislation including, but not limited to: GDPR / DPA 2018, the Data Access and Privacy Framework, and the Smart Energy Code. Data Providers may also apply additional non-standard access conditions, such as payment or purpose-based. Determining access conditions for personal data is beyond the capacity of Open Energy in Phase 3 (February - July 2021) and beyond the scope of this consultation. Future extensibility to be considered based on consultation in due course. OE-SB Currently non-standardised, determined by bilateral contract and bespoke negotiation. Subject of the current policy. OE-SA Currently some standardisation, however bespoke arrangements remain common. Subject of the current policy. OE-O No access conditions - free and accessible to all users.

OE-SB and OE-SA](../glossary.md#term-Data-sensitivity-class-shared-A) Group based access control There are two ways in which group-based access can be defined. The group can be externally defined. In this case, an external source provides documentation group membership and duration. For example, a group could be created that encompasses all UK retail energy suppliers licensed by Ofgem, or the members of a research consortium listed on a particular grant. In both cases, group membership is clearly defined by an external document (e.g. Ofgem licensee list, grant contract) applicable for a defined time period. The group can be self-defined. In this case, documentation of group membership and duration is provided by group members themselves. For example, a set of organisations partnering on a particular use-case or commercial partnership may be able to self-define as a group. Documentation may comprise a project plan or multilateral commercial agreement. Further policy-development is required to ensure the inclusion of self-defining groups in the Open Energy ecosystem is fair and transparent. Appropriate governance arrangements will also need to be established, for example to prevent confusion for Data Providers or instability associated with too-frequent changes in group creation or membership. As such, it is likely that group-based access defined through authoritative external sources will be explored first in OEGS development going forward. Use case based access control This type of access condition is difficult to design due to inherent subjectivity in defining the bounds and meaning of particular use cases. While some Data Providers could be comfortable granting access on the basis of broadly defined use cases, such as fuel poverty reduction, this may not be appropriate to all Data Providers or for more sensitive datasets. As such, it is proposed that use case-based access could also be facilitated through the creation of either externally-defined or self-defined groups as outlined above. For example, partners within a Local Authority social housing retrofit project could form a group. This group would be accompanied by information about the specific use case it represents - for example participants, timescale, activities, commercial status etc.) enabling Data Providers to make an informed decision regarding whether to grant access. Any future consideration of access based on more broadly-defined use-cases would be subject to consultation and further policy development. Prioritisation Inclusion of all access conditions outlined above will require significant technical build. In the near future, Open Energy may prioritise the establishment of access conditions that industry feedback has indicated take priority. These include: payment, security compliance, regulatory compliance and externally defined groups. As flagged above, in order to maintain robust governance and the Open Energy trust framework, development of additional access conditions may require further policy work. Data Licensing This policy has been created with input from the Open Energy Advisory Groups, Review Track, and public consultation responses. These policies are presented jointly as they unite the processes of determining who can access a particular dataset and what can be done with that dataset. Please note that this policy does not outline draft legal text of the final licences - this is being developed separately with legal support. All ideas outlined in this document remain subject to legal assessment. Creating access rules The previous section on Data Access established a set of concerns (e.g. group-based access, payment-based access etc.) which may be considered when determining who can access a dataset. To facilitate this policy, we propose a system whereby access and capability grants are determined, for each request to a Data Provider \u2019s API , on the basis of a set of rules defined and published by that Data Provider . Grants are based on three sources of information: Information from the Open Energy Governance Service ( OEGS ) about the Data Consumer making the request Information known by the Data Provider (separately from Open Energy) about the Data Consumer making the request, such as customer status, commercial relationships, bilateral agreements, active payments/subscriptions or similar Rules defined by the Data Provider - predicated on information provided by OEGS and/or, where necessary to preserve privacy or security, properties known to the Data Provider only Information provided by OEGS to Data Providers can cover two kinds of properties: Inherently true properties known to Open Energy, such as: The unique ID of the Data Consumer The Data Consumer represents a Local Authority / SME / Enterprise / Community Organisation / Academic group, etc The Data Consumer has a particular identity such as a registered name Open Energy has performed identity assurance to a particular level Transient, time-bounded properties known to Open Energy, such as: The Data Consumer is a member of a particular scheme, group, or consortium (e.g. a two-year academic research project under a particular named grant) The Data Consumer has signed a particular document on a particular date (e.g. documentation of a research partnership) When defining an access rule, Data Providers will also be required to confirm whether the rule is definitive or indicative. Definitive rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions will be given access. Indicative rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions may be given access, but there may also be other conditions (e.g. the existence of a payment or bilateral agreement) that must be confirmed by the Data Provider outside the Open Energy ecosystem before access is granted. If access requests are refused, Data Providers must be able to demonstrate a justifiable reason for doing so. Data Consumers can challenge access refusals through a dispute-resolution mechanism (part of the OEGS ) if this is required. Guidance regarding acceptable/unacceptable reasons for access refusal, the dispute-resolution mechanism, and OEGS dispute-resolution processes will be developed and published in Phase 4 of the project. The flow of information associated with access control is shown below - this assumes the Data Consumer has already acquired an access token from the authorization server. Access control and capability grants are processed on a pre-request basis, within the Data Provider , in the box Make access and license decision based on details : Associating access rules with capabilities In the Open Energy model, licensing is expressed as the grant of a set of capabilities and associated obligations, scoped to the results of a single API call and verified through a non-repudiable digital signature. This is defined using a rules language, the details of which can be found at Access Control and Capability Grant Language What are licenses and capabilities? A data licence is a legal instrument setting out what a Data Consumer can do with a particular artefact (e.g. dataset). This grants certain \u2018capabilities\u2019 to the Data Consumer , comprising a clear expression of things they can do with the artefact. For example, the CC-BY 4.0 Creative Commons licence is highly permissive, granting capabilities such as: reuse of the licensed artefact for any purpose, redistribution of the artefact, and sharing derivatives of the artefact - so long as the author is credited with the original. By contrast, the CC-BY-ND 4.0 Creative Commons licence grants the capability to reuse the licensed artefact for any purpose, however it does not grant the capability to redistribute derivatives of the artefact. How will capability grants work in practice? Each time a Data Consumer makes an API call, the data returned will be associated with a particular set of capability grants. These can be bound to the data through a non-repudiable digital signature, designed to ensure transparency in the event of any disputes regarding data use. Capability grants will be converted into a licence through the Open Energy Governance Service ( OEGS ). Alongside the legal text of the licence, the OEGS will make details of capabilities available to Data Consumers as an easy to understand set of notation/icons. Open Energy Search will also show the license (capabilities and obligations) associated with a dataset in the search results, allowing for searches to be filtered by license in order to promote transparency from the outset. Open Energy defines a set of common capabilities - Data Providers may create custom capabilities, but we strongly suggest that this should only be done in exceptional cases. The common initial set of capabilities can be found at Standard capabilities . We propose to use this list as the building blocks for our system of capability grants; whereby the range of capabilities, associated legal text, and \u2018human readable\u2019 notation/icons is standardised within the Open Energy ecosystem. NOTE : There is potential for redistribution of derivatives to be managed in more granularity through use of the data pyramid (see Figure 2 below). This could permit Data Providers to specify what level of derivative insights can be passed on (e.g. raw data / results of analysis / recommendations building on analysis). Obligations accompanying capability grants Capability grants will be accompanied by details of any obligations that the Data Consumer must abide by when exercising a capability. Data Providers must specify any such obligations when associating capabilities with an access rule. As with capabilities, the range of obligations will be standardised within the Open Energy ecosystem and will be included in the digital signature binding the API return with the capability grant. Open Energy research has identified a set of common obligations associated with capabilities granted by licences used in the energy sector. These include obligations to: Credit the author(s) of the original artefact. Provide a statement accompanying derivatives works/products/services explaining that the original (credited) artefact was used in their creation. Provide ownership statements for derivative works/products/services. License any derivative works/products/services with the same capabilities (\u2018share-alike\u2019). Establish a limit in liability for use of the data in its current state. We propose to use this list as the building blocks for our system of obligations accompanying capability grants; whereby the range of associations, associated legal text, and \u2018human readable\u2019 notation/icons is standardised within the Open Energy ecosystem. Why are we proposing this approach? Constructing a single licence for each dataset, designed to govern all possible scenarios for its use, has to date resulted in the creation of long, complex licensing agreements that are not easily readable by Data Consumers . Industry feedback indicates that this creates friction and costs, for example associated with data-related legal support or accidental misuse of licensed data. These issues are further compounded by growth in the creation of bespoke licences that include non-standard capabilities or legal wording. Open Energy has identified an alternative approach to single data licences, which is currently more commonly used within data science and software development communities outside of the energy sector. This approach permits dual or multiple licensing of an artefact, whereby the individual licences are kept as simple as possible. For example, dual licensing is commonly used in circumstances where software code is released for free under one licence, then to paying customers under a more permissive licence. Our approach accepts that a degree of licence pluralism is necessary, and indeed valuable, in supporting a diversity of data types, actors and use-cases within the energy data ecosystem. We are aware that a multiple licensing approach may prompt some concern regarding a risk of licence proliferation and/or opacity. However, our approach can reduce these risks by rationalising and standardising the parameters in which licensing occurs. To do this, Open Energy will work to standardise the range of capabilities offered, the legal text governing how these capabilities are expressed, and the \u2018human-readable\u2019 ways in which these capabilities are communicated to Data Consumers . Beyond Phase 3, we will further develop guidance for Data Providers encouraging simplicity and discouraging unnecessary protectionism, while also maintaining appropriate protections for higher sensitivity classes of data. Early feedback from Advisory Groups and critical friends has suggested that benefits of this approach could include reduced legal, staff and time costs associated with improved searchability, transparency, readability and standardisation of capability grants. By making licensing simpler and faster, it could also help level the digital playing field by offering particular benefits to new, small or \u2018public interest\u2019 actors lacking in-house expertise or budget. In the longer term, adoption of this approach could have benefits across the sector as new data markets incentivise Data Providers to align with Open Energy standardisation. Example access control and capability grant scenarios NOTE : These scenarios have been created to reflect decisions that could be faced by Data Providers in our Phase 3 use-case, in which a Local Authority is seeking data to plan the retrofit of social housing with low carbon technologies. Please note that the scenarios are exemplary only and do not necessarily represent the stances of any Data Providers involved in testing. Scenario 1 Dataset DNO capacity/constraint data Sensitivity class OE-SA Access control domains Access granted to all Open Energy members equally Access rules oe:member unary access condition Capability grants oe:member grants oe:use_any , all Data Consumers who are members of Open Energy can access this data set, and receive the right to use for any purpose (see Standard capabilities for more detail) Obligations Derivatives of the artefact must be accompanied by text stating that the original artefact was used in their creation. oe:member grants oe:use_any requires oe:by (see Standard obligations for more detail) Scenario 2 Dataset Public Electric vehicle chargepoint use and economic performance profiles Sensitivity class OE-SB Access control domains Group-based and payment-based access conditions Access rules Two distinct access constraints: oe:org_type in ['local_authority', 'academic'], provider:customer_level == 1 - local authorities and educational institutions are granted access if they are paid customers of the Data Provider at their standard rate provider:customer_level >= 2 - energy networks are granted access if they are paid customers of the Data Provider at their large business level Capability grants In this scenario it would be technically possible for the Data Provider to apply different capability grants to the two different access rules. In this case the Data Provider chooses not to as they have charged commercial entities a higher access fee and are therefore happy for all Data Consumers to be granted the same capabilities. The result is the same set of capabilities (the same licence) is applied to both access rules. oe:org_type in ['local_authority', 'academic'], provider:customer_level == 1 grants oe:use_any provider:customer_level >= 2 grants oe:use_any Obligations The Data Provider chooses the same obligations to be applied to both access rules oe:org_type in ['local_authority', 'academic'], provider:customer_level == 1 grants oe:use_any requires oe:by provider:customer_level >= 2 grants oe:use_any requires oe:by NOTE : Scenario 2 This more complex scenario detailed above involves a combination of properties known to Open Energy (the market sector of the Data Consumer - Local Authority, Educational Institution, or Energy Network) along with properties which are only known to the Data Provider (the payment status of the Data Consumer ). We can do this because the rules are evaluated within the Data Provider , and not externally within Open Energy\u2019s Governance Service, an entity which is not aware of any commercial arrangements between the Data Provider and Data Consumer . Scenario 3 Dataset Solar panel performance data Sensitivity class OE-SB Access control domains Use case-based and payment-based access conditions Access rules Two rules are created: oe_group:plymouth_lct - access to use case participants, here defined as a group lct managed by plymouth (the ID of a local council organisation) and administered using the OEGS facilities provider:customer - access to all other Open Energy members if they have a paid account with the Data Provider Capability grants The Data Provider chooses to apply two different capability grants (dual licences) for the two access rules, reflecting the fact that their dataset is commercially sensitive, therefore they require payment for its use beyond non-profit or development activities. oe_group:plymouth_lct grants oe:use_dev, oe:use_noncom provider:customer grants oe:use_any, oe:redistribute_combined, oe:combine_any, oe:adapt_any Obligations The original source of the artefact must be credited in all direct uses, derivatives of the artefact must be. accompanied by text stating that the original artefact was used in their creation, and derivatives must be licensed under the same terms as the original: oe_group:plymouth_lct grants oe:use_dev, oe:use_noncom requires oe:sa, oe:by The original source of the artefact must be credited in all direct uses, and derivatives of the artefact must be accompanied by text stating that the original artefact was used in their creation. There is no obligation to license derivatives of the artefact under the same terms as the original: provider:customer grants oe:use_any, oe:redistribute_combined, oe:combine_any, oe:adapt_any requires oe:by Risks of license proliferation As outlined in previous consultations, the Open Energy data ecosystem is more complex than Open Banking. We are therefore proposing a different approach to licensing in order to balance a wide range of needs and data types. The approach further responds to feedback from our Advisory Groups and Review Track that data access and licensing cannot be served by a one size fits all approach as this would risk restricting the diversity of the ecosystem and potentially undermining the strength of the trust framework. We are aware of concerns within the industry that multiple licensing could present risks of licence proliferation, introducing complexity to the landscape which can act as a barrier for data consumption. Open Energy acknowledges this risk and presents the following points of response: Firstly, some stakeholders have suggested that Open Energy should take a \u2018modular approach\u2019 to building a \u2018single Open Energy licence\u2019. This suggestion outlines a permissive core or standard licence that is presented to all Data Providers as the default option for publishing their data. If this is not appropriate for a particular dataset, Data Providers would then have the option of adding restrictions (i.e. removing capabilities) by adding modular sections of legal text. In practice however, a modular approach doesn\u2019t reduce licence plurality as each modification of a licence (e.g. addition of modular text) is viewed legally as the creation of a new licence. Open Energy\u2019s approach instead accepts a degree of licence plurality, but will work to standardise the discoverability, scope and ease of understanding of that pluralism by offering a limited, standardised and searchable range of capabilities. This will be accompanied in due course by guidance for Data Providers , tailored to each sensitivity class, encouraging as much openness as possible while publishing data safely and creating a thriving marketplace. Secondly, we acknowledge that the energy data landscape already incorporates a significant degree of licence proliferation. For example, it is already common for energy system actors to publish data under bespoke licences containing non-standard clauses and/or legal wording. In standardising the range and expression of capabilities, Open Energy aims to rationalise some unnecessary forms of licence proliferation in the sector and reduce legal costs to Data Providers by reducing the circumstances under which bespoke licences are necessary. Is there a risk of licences changing too frequently or without notice? In any licensing model that is not explicitly time-bound, there is a risk that the Data Provider may choose to change the licence arbitrarily. We have received feedback that bespoke licensing in the energy sector already produces insecurity for Data Consumers , who are concerned about the longevity of particular licences in a changeable environment. For example, an energy forecasting company relies on predictable access to, and capabilities to use, a range of datasets (e.g. weather data). Changes to the capabilities granted for any of these datasets undermine this kind of business model, with additional proxy consequences for carbon savings that could be achieved as a result of better integration of renewable energy generation. Open Energy aims to address this problem by encouraging Data Providers to indicate the length of time they commit to retaining the same capability grant for a particular access rule. Although this will be optional, we hope that Data Providers will be incentivised to do so as this encourages confidence in the market. We are also exploring the possibility of building a notification system to alert Data Consumers either to upcoming or new changes in capability grants to ensure this is done transparently and with adequate warning where possible. NOTE : The time ranges described above are NOT a time limit on the capabilities granted in response to a single request, it instead specifies a range within which the access rules and their corresponding capability grants will not change. Beyond designing positive behavioural and market incentives, it is beyond the scope of Open Energy to control licence-changes as this remains within the legal rights of the Data Provider . Where are these rules specified? The access control, capability, and obligation grants form part of the metadata for a dataset. This is expressed in a file, hosted and maintained by the Data Provider responsible for the data set. The provisional structure of the entire file can be found at Data Set Metadata , in particular the section on the Access Block Where are these rules evaluated, and by whom? Following our guiding principle that Data Providers remain in control of their data at all times, these rules are evaluated within the Data Provider API implementation. This is necessary to allow for decisions predicated on information only known to the Data Provider , but this could impose additional complexity when setting up and implementing a Data Provider . To mitigate this, we will provide clear specifications and semantics for the rules language, along with a reference implementation in the Python language. The current language specification can be found at Access Control and Capability Grant Language , the time bounds and other properties form part of the Access Block specification in the metadata file format. Service Desk and Notifications Open Energy acknowledges industry feedback regarding the need to develop a Service Desk and notifications function. Developing the full function is beyond the scope of project Phase 3, however it remains an active area for future development. In the meantime, members will be directed to use a specific email address to catalogue emerging needs and discuss appropriate OEGS support. We proposed to use learning from this prototype to inform future service and policy design. Dispute Resolution Open Energy acknowledges industry feedback regarding the need to develop a dispute resolution function as part of the OEGS . While developing the full function of dispute resolution falls beyond the scope of Open Energy Phase 3, this remains an active area for future development. Given the complexity of this topic, ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation will be used to shape the future service. In the meantime, members will be requested to use a specific email address to catalogue any difficulties and discuss appropriate OEGS support. Learning from this prototype will inform future service and policy design, alongside consultation activity.","title":"Core Policies"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#core-policies","text":"","title":"Core Policies"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#introduction-core-policies","text":"This section aims to outline core policies and principles with implications for all members of the Open Energy ecosystem.

Commercial sensitivity considers intellectual property, risk and commerciality. Security sensitivity includes critical national infrastructure and cybersecurity. Classes are presented in the table below. A definition, specification and dataset examples for each class will be provided in the Open Energy Operational Guidelines. Data Providers will then assess their datasets using the Operational Guidelines and allocate them to a class, prior to sharing them via the Open Energy ecosystem.

In both cases, group membership is clearly defined by an external document (e.g. Ofgem licensee list, grant contract) applicable for a defined time period. The group can be self-defined. In this case, documentation of group membership and duration is provided by group members themselves.

To facilitate this policy, we propose a system whereby access and capability grants are determined, for each request to a Data Provider \u2019s API , on the basis of a set of rules defined and published by that Data Provider . Grants are based on three sources of information: Information from the Open Energy Governance Service ( OEGS ) about the Data Consumer making the request Information known by the Data Provider (separately from Open Energy) about the Data Consumer making the request, such as customer status, commercial relationships, bilateral agreements, active payments/subscriptions or similar Rules defined by the Data Provider - predicated on information provided by OEGS and/or, where necessary to preserve privacy or security, properties known to the Data Provider only Information provided by OEGS to Data Providers can cover two kinds of properties: Inherently true properties known to Open Energy, such as: The unique ID of the Data Consumer The Data Consumer represents a Local Authority / SME / Enterprise / Community Organisation / Academic group, etc The Data Consumer has a particular identity such as a registered name Open Energy has performed identity assurance to a particular level Transient, time-bounded properties known to Open Energy, such as: The Data Consumer is a member of a particular scheme, group, or consortium (e.g. a two-year academic research project under a particular named grant) The Data Consumer has signed a particular document on a particular date (e.g. documentation of a research partnership) When defining an access rule, Data Providers will also be required to confirm whether the rule is definitive or indicative. Definitive rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions will be given access. Indicative rules stipulate that a Data Consumer satisfying the stated conditions may be given access, but there may also be other conditions (e.g. the existence of a payment or bilateral agreement) that must be confirmed by the Data Provider outside the Open Energy ecosystem before access is granted. If access requests are refused, Data Providers must be able to demonstrate a justifiable reason for doing so. Data Consumers can challenge access refusals through a dispute-resolution mechanism (part of the OEGS ) if this is required. Guidance regarding acceptable/unacceptable reasons for access refusal, the dispute-resolution mechanism, and OEGS dispute-resolution processes will be developed and published in Phase 4 of the project. The flow of information associated with access control is shown below - this assumes the Data Consumer has already acquired an access token from the authorization server.

For example, the CC-BY 4.0 Creative Commons licence is highly permissive, granting capabilities such as: reuse of the licensed artefact for any purpose, redistribution of the artefact, and sharing derivatives of the artefact - so long as the author is credited with the original. By contrast, the CC-BY-ND 4.0 Creative Commons licence grants the capability to reuse the licensed artefact for any purpose, however it does not grant the capability to redistribute derivatives of the artefact.","title":"What are licenses and capabilities?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#how-will-capability-grants-work-in-practice","text":"Each time a Data Consumer makes an API call, the data returned will be associated with a particular set of capability grants. These can be bound to the data through a non-repudiable digital signature, designed to ensure transparency in the event of any disputes regarding data use. Capability grants will be converted into a licence through the Open Energy Governance Service ( OEGS ). Alongside the legal text of the licence, the OEGS will make details of capabilities available to Data Consumers as an easy to understand set of notation/icons. Open Energy Search will also show the license (capabilities and obligations) associated with a dataset in the search results, allowing for searches to be filtered by license in order to promote transparency from the outset. Open Energy defines a set of common capabilities - Data Providers may create custom capabilities, but we strongly suggest that this should only be done in exceptional cases. The common initial set of capabilities can be found at Standard capabilities . We propose to use this list as the building blocks for our system of capability grants; whereby the range of capabilities, associated legal text, and \u2018human readable\u2019 notation/icons is standardised within the Open Energy ecosystem. NOTE : There is potential for redistribution of derivatives to be managed in more granularity through use of the data pyramid (see Figure 2 below). This could permit Data Providers to specify what level of derivative insights can be passed on (e.g. raw data / results of analysis / recommendations building on analysis).","title":"How will capability grants work in practice?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#obligations-accompanying-capability-grants","text":"Capability grants will be accompanied by details of any obligations that the Data Consumer must abide by when exercising a capability.

Open Energy research has identified a set of common obligations associated with capabilities granted by licences used in the energy sector. These include obligations to: Credit the author(s) of the original artefact. Provide a statement accompanying derivatives works/products/services explaining that the original (credited) artefact was used in their creation. Provide ownership statements for derivative works/products/services. License any derivative works/products/services with the same capabilities (\u2018share-alike\u2019).

Industry feedback indicates that this creates friction and costs, for example associated with data-related legal support or accidental misuse of licensed data. These issues are further compounded by growth in the creation of bespoke licences that include non-standard capabilities or legal wording. Open Energy has identified an alternative approach to single data licences, which is currently more commonly used within data science and software development communities outside of the energy sector. This approach permits dual or multiple licensing of an artefact, whereby the individual licences are kept as simple as possible. For example, dual licensing is commonly used in circumstances where software code is released for free under one licence, then to paying customers under a more permissive licence. Our approach accepts that a degree of licence pluralism is necessary, and indeed valuable, in supporting a diversity of data types, actors and use-cases within the energy data ecosystem. We are aware that a multiple licensing approach may prompt some concern regarding a risk of licence proliferation and/or opacity. However, our approach can reduce these risks by rationalising and standardising the parameters in which licensing occurs. To do this, Open Energy will work to standardise the range of capabilities offered, the legal text governing how these capabilities are expressed, and the \u2018human-readable\u2019 ways in which these capabilities are communicated to Data Consumers . Beyond Phase 3, we will further develop guidance for Data Providers encouraging simplicity and discouraging unnecessary protectionism, while also maintaining appropriate protections for higher sensitivity classes of data. Early feedback from Advisory Groups and critical friends has suggested that benefits of this approach could include reduced legal, staff and time costs associated with improved searchability, transparency, readability and standardisation of capability grants. By making licensing simpler and faster, it could also help level the digital playing field by offering particular benefits to new, small or \u2018public interest\u2019 actors lacking in-house expertise or budget. In the longer term, adoption of this approach could have benefits across the sector as new data markets incentivise Data Providers to align with Open Energy standardisation.","title":"Why are we proposing this approach?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#example-access-control-and-capability-grant-scenarios","text":"NOTE : These scenarios have been created to reflect decisions that could be faced by Data Providers in our Phase 3 use-case, in which a Local Authority is seeking data to plan the retrofit of social housing with low carbon technologies.

We are therefore proposing a different approach to licensing in order to balance a wide range of needs and data types. The approach further responds to feedback from our Advisory Groups and Review Track that data access and licensing cannot be served by a one size fits all approach as this would risk restricting the diversity of the ecosystem and potentially undermining the strength of the trust framework. We are aware of concerns within the industry that multiple licensing could present risks of licence proliferation, introducing complexity to the landscape which can act as a barrier for data consumption. Open Energy acknowledges this risk and presents the following points of response: Firstly, some stakeholders have suggested that Open Energy should take a \u2018modular approach\u2019 to building a \u2018single Open Energy licence\u2019. This suggestion outlines a permissive core or standard licence that is presented to all Data Providers as the default option for publishing their data. If this is not appropriate for a particular dataset, Data Providers would then have the option of adding restrictions (i.e. removing capabilities) by adding modular sections of legal text. In practice however, a modular approach doesn\u2019t reduce licence plurality as each modification of a licence (e.g. addition of modular text) is viewed legally as the creation of a new licence. Open Energy\u2019s approach instead accepts a degree of licence plurality, but will work to standardise the discoverability, scope and ease of understanding of that pluralism by offering a limited, standardised and searchable range of capabilities. This will be accompanied in due course by guidance for Data Providers , tailored to each sensitivity class, encouraging as much openness as possible while publishing data safely and creating a thriving marketplace. Secondly, we acknowledge that the energy data landscape already incorporates a significant degree of licence proliferation. For example, it is already common for energy system actors to publish data under bespoke licences containing non-standard clauses and/or legal wording. In standardising the range and expression of capabilities, Open Energy aims to rationalise some unnecessary forms of licence proliferation in the sector and reduce legal costs to Data Providers by reducing the circumstances under which bespoke licences are necessary.","title":"Risks of license proliferation"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#is-there-a-risk-of-licences-changing-too-frequently-or-without-notice","text":"In any licensing model that is not explicitly time-bound, there is a risk that the Data Provider may choose to change the licence arbitrarily. We have received feedback that bespoke licensing in the energy sector already produces insecurity for Data Consumers , who are concerned about the longevity of particular licences in a changeable environment. For example, an energy forecasting company relies on predictable access to, and capabilities to use, a range of datasets (e.g. weather data). Changes to the capabilities granted for any of these datasets undermine this kind of business model, with additional proxy consequences for carbon savings that could be achieved as a result of better integration of renewable energy generation. Open Energy aims to address this problem by encouraging Data Providers to indicate the length of time they commit to retaining the same capability grant for a particular access rule. Although this will be optional, we hope that Data Providers will be incentivised to do so as this encourages confidence in the market. We are also exploring the possibility of building a notification system to alert Data Consumers either to upcoming or new changes in capability grants to ensure this is done transparently and with adequate warning where possible. NOTE : The time ranges described above are NOT a time limit on the capabilities granted in response to a single request, it instead specifies a range within which the access rules and their corresponding capability grants will not change. Beyond designing positive behavioural and market incentives, it is beyond the scope of Open Energy to control licence-changes as this remains within the legal rights of the Data Provider .","title":"Is there a risk of licences changing too frequently or without notice?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/common_policies/#where-are-these-rules-specified","text":"The access control, capability, and obligation grants form part of the metadata for a dataset.

Data Providers MUST ensure that access conditions and capability grants are non-discriminatory and fair to Data Consumers Data Providers SHOULD ensure that the validity time bounds of any published capability grants are sufficient for reasonable commercial operation of a data consumer Responsibility - Data provision Data Providers are responsible for providing a data API for each data set, and for configuring and securing each API in accordance with the kinds of data it exposes (along with any other access conditions deemed necessary and appropriate by the Data Provider on a per-data-set basis) Open data MUST be made available with no authentication or authorization requirements Shared data MUST made available through a FAPI compliant resource server connected to the OEGS \u2019s authorization service (see Common Security Requirements for more details) Data formats Open Energy does not define or mandate individual data formats to be returned from data APIs - the diversity of kinds of information in the sector renders this impractical, and the additional overhead imposed on data providers would be undesirable. With this said, we would encourage Data Providers to consider likely automated consumption of data when designing their data APIs - this implies using machine readable formats such as CSV , JSON and similar, with a preference for those formats compatible with existing software tools and libraries. Responsibility - Data integrity and correctness Data Providers are responsible for the correctness of data returned by their published data APIs . The OEGS will provide a mechanism by which Data Consumers can report any data quality issues, and will convey any such reports to a nominated contact within the Data Provider . Responsibility - Metadata provision Data Providers are responsible for creating, and publishing, metadata for each exposed data set. This provides visibility of each data set within the Open Energy Governance Service ( OEGS ) Registry. The metadata file covers, for each provided data set, whether shared or open: Semantic content Access rules and licensing of the data set Transport mechanism specification Syntactic content The content and format of the metadata file can be found at Data Set Metadata . The Data Provider is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of this metadata. Responsibility - API availability Data Providers are responsible for availability of their published data APIs . Availability will be monitored automatically by the OEGS , availability information will form part of the metadata for each data set record in the OEGS Registry. The OEGS will provide a mechanism for Data Providers to announce scheduled downtime when planned, and to report unscheduled downtime when necessary. Responsibility - API stability and change management Data Providers are responsible for managing any change to the data APIs such that disruption to Data Consumers is minimised. This is handled through: Semantic versioning of all API methods Publication of anticipated changes and retirement of API versions through the OEGS Changeover periods where new and prior API versions are run in parallel Data API Requirements Unlike open banking, open energy does not mandate particular APIs for data provision - it is expected that there will be a variety of mechanisms to expose data, with varying inputs (from a single data set ID to a complex query object) and varying kinds of output dependent on the information exposed. With that said, there are certain properties that all data APIs must satisfy to interoperate successfully with other parties within the open energy ecosystem. We refer to endpoints used to retrieve energy data as data endpoints, and others as infrastructure endpoints. Date and time formats Whenever date or time quantities are accepted or returned from a data API , these values MUST conform to |RFC| 3339 . This is referenced elsewhere in this document as date/time Endpoint security Open data endpoints Data endpoints which provide access to open data (in class OE-O ) MUST NOT require any form of authentication prior to access. This includes allowing access to entities which are not members of the open energy ecosystem. Shared data endpoints Data endpoints which provide access to shared data (in classes OE-SA and OE-SB ) MUST implement the subset of the resource server part of the FAPI specification used within Open Energy as described in Common Security Requirements , and authorize against the OEGS authorization service. Protected data endpoints MAY use the token introspection mechanism provided by FAPI to gather additional information about the client making the request prior to any access decision. Heartbeat and monitoring endpoint All data APIs SHOULD include a FAPI protected heartbeat infrastructure endpoint. This serves two purposes: It allows the OEGS to monitor the liveness of the data API It provides some level of verification that the resource server has been correctly configured The heartbeat endpoint location is defined within the data set metadata file, if specified it MUST respond to GET requests from the OEGS monitoring system with a 200 status code. If the heartbeat response contains a body, the body will be interpreted by the OEGS monitoring system as a JSON dictionary containing statistics for the period between the most recent two successful calls to the heartbeat endpoint (including the call to which this is a response). This response is RECOMMENDED as it provides oversight of API usage to the OEGS . Legal keys, and the semantics of their associated values, are as follows: Name Content period_start date/time of the start of the period for which statistics are reported period_end date/time of the end of the period for which statistics are reported, this will typically be the date and time of the heartbeat request api_call_response_[CODE]_count integer number of requests to non-heartbeat endpoints within this data API which resulted in a response of type CODE. A distinct key:value pair is sent in the response for each distinct HTTP status code returned. API documentation Data APIs MUST be described within the transport section of the data set metadata file. Versioning All data APIs MUST include a version number in the path of each data endpoint. This version SHOULD use semantic versioning to differentiate between breaking and backwards compatible changes. This MUST be documented within the Open|API| transport section of the metadata file. Problem Resolution (Data Providers) Effective resolution of problems (Data Providers) A Data Provider MUST create documentation to clearly outline the policies, processes and systems it has in place for problem resolution and its respective service level objectives. This framework should enable the effective resolution of Data Consumer issues and therefore cater for problems that relate specifically to a Data Consumer \u2019s use of a Data Provider \u2019s data APIs . In the event that a Data Consumer is unable to resolve an issue with a Data Provider , the issue MAY be flagged to the OEGS Dispute Resolution function for independent support. Online support Data Providers SHOULD provide Frequently Asked Questions , which address areas that may be specific to Data Consumers such as technical advice or test facility guidance. They should also consider a means of identifying recurring questions or user-error issues so these can be collated into Frequently Asked Questions to support the early resolution of problems. Problem resolution documentation, Frequently Asked Questions , contact details, opening times and out of hours support SHOULD be published and easily accessible in one collective area on the Data Provider \u2019s website. Ticket management process Data Providers MUST ensure they have a functioning ticket management system which enables them to respond to issues and problems raised within clearly defined service level targets. A successful problem resolution framework will enable the efficient identification and resolution of problems which specifically impact Data Consumers . The system for raising and reporting on tickets should be transparent in order to fully inform users and engender trust across the ecosystem. Dispute resolution for access control and capability grant policies (Data Providers) In cases where a Data Consumer believes that access conditions or capability grant rules are being applied unfairly, the OEGS will act as a mediating party. OEGS support (Data Providers) The OEGS Service Desk will provide participants with a supplementary ticket management process and supports Data Providers in communicating problems to ecosystem participants via the noticeboard. Change Management This section outlines various change scenarios that may impact Data Consumers , and provides guidance for a Data Provider to consider when implementing a change and communicating to Data Consumers . Downtime Planned downtime, by definition, is something that a Data Provider anticipates and therefore is able to give advance notice to Data Consumers . It is not generally possible to give advance notice of unplanned downtime, but Data Providers should give notice as soon as they are aware of the downtime. When providing notifications, Data Providers SHOULD provide a specific time period, so Data Consumers are aware that the data API will be unavailable for that time, or upon a subsequent notification to confirm that the service has been reinstated sooner than anticipated. OEGS Support Services can assist Data Providers with the dissemination of downtime information to the wider Open Energy ecosystem via its central noticeboard facility. Planned downtime should be given at least five business days before the event. Apart from cancelling the planned downtime, no changes should be made to the planned downtime notification within the five business day period. Where practical, Data Providers should give advance notice via their own website, developer portal or OEGS of any planned downtime one calendar month in advance. Licensing and access control changes Data Providers MUST provide advance notice of any changes to access control and capability grant policies. This is normally covered by the time-bounded nature of these grants, but Data Providers MAY also use any notification services provided by the OEGS to publish additional information about changes. Data API changes Data Providers may periodically wish to upgrade and / or to deprecate versions of their data APIs . The following mitigation measures will reduce the impact on service providers of these changes. Dual running and deprecation Data Providers SHOULD support a minimum of two non-compatible API versions in a production context, providing both versions were previously supported by the Data Provider , for a period of time long enough to ensure that Data Consumers have had sufficient time to successfully test the new version and migrate their applications and customers. OEGS recommends dual running for at least six months for a major version, and three months for a minor version. Where a Data Provider implements a data API for the first time, they will only need to support this one version to start with. The deprecation of unsupported versions is at the Data Provider \u2019s discretion \u2013 based on usage metrics. However, the OEGS may recommend that any specific version (major, minor, or patch) should be deprecated at any time, and this should be implemented within three months of notification by the OEGS . This is to cater for critical defects, especially those relating to security. In exceptional circumstances it may be agreed by OEGS that support for a specific version is terminated earlier. Data Providers must not apply any measures to induce Data Consumers to adopt a new version of the APIs (e.g. rate limiting the older version while providing better performance on a newer version). API credentials, consent and authorisation API Credentials associated with an API should be version agnostic. Therefore, a Data Consumer accessing v1.0, v1.1 or v2.0 should be able to use the same API Credentials across all available API endpoints.","title":"Guidance for Data Providers"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/data_provider_ops_guidelines/#guidance-for-data-providers","text":"NOTE : This document is primarily intended for technical and operations teams within organisations wishing to participate in Open Energy as Data Providers .

The guidelines are supplemented by links to more detailed technical and membership documentation. Overarching aims of these operational guidelines: To deliver a safe and effective Open Energy ecosystem that meets the needs of members and supports the broader sector transition to Net Zero by enabling better discovery and sharing of data via a robust trust framework. To support the operational requirements of Data Providers and Data Consumers , stimulating an active Open Energy ecosystem. This includes ensuring that all members understand the sensitivity classes, access, and licensing models for data shared in the ecosystem. To encourage an active data sharing ecosystem in which transparency and interoperability are incentivised. To ensure positive member experiences that demonstrate the value of Open Energy and encourage them to continue participating in the ecosystem. To minimise potential costs associated with insufficient API or other technical system testing, downtime, or other common faults. To reduce any reputational risks associated with individual members, incorrect application of core policies, or the Open Energy ecosystem as a whole. These guidelines are structured in six sections, outlining: Introduction (this section): background to the Open Energy project, clarifications of the roles and responsibilities of different types of actors operating in the Open Energy ecosystem. Open Energy Glossary : definitions of common acronyms, terminology, and technical tools used in Open Energy documentation. Considerations Before You Start : \u2018at a glance\u2019 list of items that all types of new members will need to consider in order to meet operational requirements. NOTE : The Considerations before you start is still in review and so is not present in this version of the documentation Core Policies : operational principles and policies central to Open Energy function. Includes policies governing data sensitivity classification, access controls, and licensing. Guidance for Data Consumers and Guidance for Data Providers : guidelines outlining how Data Providers can share data safely and securely via the Open Energy ecosystem while retaining strong control, provide appropriate and timely metadata, and design safe and effective APIs enabling data-sharing. Guidelines outlining how Data Consumers can meet the requirements for offering data services, access and licensing conditions for different data classes, and best practice with regards to testing, security, ethics and dispute management. Additional Material : links to other relevant documentation (e.g. technical, legal, etc.) sitting outside the operational guidelines. WARNING : Disclaimer : The contents of the Operational Guidelines do not constitute legal advice. While they have been drafted with regard to relevant regulatory provisions and best practice, they are not a complete list of the regulatory or legal obligations that apply to members and users of Open Energy. Although intended to be consistent with relevant regulations and laws, in the event of any conflict, those regulations and laws will take priority. Participants are responsible for their own compliance with all applicable regulations and laws, including but not limited to: data protection and privacy, consumer protection laws, and energy sector licences and codes (where applicable). The Open Energy operational guidelines will be revised in future in accordance with further development of services offered in the ecosystem, or changes to the regulatory and policy environment in which it operates. Please ensure that you are referring to the most current version of the guidelines prior to reading. What is Open Energy, how was it made and who is it for? Open Energy is an ambitious, non-profit project working with the energy industry, government and the regulator to modernise access to energy data and break down barriers to data sharing. Open Energy makes it easier to discover, share, access and use energy and related datasets, supporting the sector\u2019s drive towards decarbonisation and its related social and economic benefits. Open Energy received initial development funding from the Modernising Energy Data Access competition, backed by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ( BEIS ), and Innovate UK . The project has built on learning from Open Banking - identifying which elements are transferable to the energy sector, and which require adaptation or fresh thinking. Throughout this process, the Open Energy team has engaged in extensive consultation with the energy sector, in order to ensure that the project meets the widest possible variety of needs. The ethos of Open Energy will remain grounded in sector engagement and a collaborative approach as the project moves forward. Open Energy aims to serve all actors in the energy sector, and appropriate parts of allied sectors, who are looking to share data, access data, or both. Membership is open to a wide range of organisations - from large corporations through to charities, researchers, or community groups. Both Open : and Shared Data can flow within the Open Energy ecosystem. How is Open Energy Structured? Open Energy consists of two core functions: dataset search and discovery, and the Open Energy Governance Service. These functions are described below. Dataset Search Open Energy\u2019s first core function - Open Energy Search - enables dataset search and discovery. Open Energy Search empowers users to find out what datasets exist and who owns/controls them. Search results also outline the sensitivity class , access rules , and capability grants associated with a certain dataset, meaning that access and licensing details are transparent. This works through a search engine designed specifically to search for datasets, with options to search by different parameters in order to refine results. It can also be used to discover datasets adjacent to searches; helping users to build up a more rounded picture of the energy data landscape in their sphere of interest. Open Energy search is free, available to all, and will remain so. Access pathways to Open and Shared data are described in the following section. Datasets provided by Open Energy members ( Data Providers ) and non-Open Energy members (e.g. web scraped Open Data) may both be visible in Open Energy Search. Datasets provided by an Open Energy member will be demarcated with a green tick to indicate that the provenance of the dataset has been verified, uptime is monitored, documentation format is known, and users have a mechanism to provide feedback on the dataset if issues are detected. (Please note that this does not indicate that Open Energy has carried out further, more extensive checks on data quality within members\u2019 datasets.) Governance Service Open Energy\u2019s second core function - our Governance Service ( OEGS ) - supports members to provide, share and access different classes of Shared data (see Data Sensitivity Classes ) on the basis of preemptive licensing (see Data Licensing ). Shared Data accessed via the OEGS will be provided by members only ( Data Providers ). The Governance Service aims to provide a secure, trusted mechanism to improve data sharing across the sector by reducing the time and financial costs currently associated with accessing Shared data. For providers of Shared data, the Governance Service offers a secure and effective way to list datasets and set appropriate access and licensing requirements. For actors wishing to access Shared data, the Governance Service provides a mechanism to reduce friction and bilateral contract negotiation, even when requesting access to multiple datasets from different providers. Project Governance During Phase 3, Open Energy was governed by two Advisory Groups (Membership and Delivery) and a Steering Group. The groups met once a month and a brief description of each group\u2019s activities is given below. Membership Advisory Group : Consulted on the Membership contract, key policies, including conditions to participate, roles, responsibilities and liabilities, draft preemptive licence, funding model, operational guidelines, and ongoing governance. Delivery Advisory Group : Consulted on the drafting of operational guidelines and understanding data production and usage. Fed into the requirements for technical delivery of the Open Energy Governance Service and the Energy Data Search to ensure they meet user needs. Alongside this, examined the day-to-day operational aspects of Open Energy including security and systems. Steering Group : Supported the overarching strategy, ensured the delivery of our objectives, and helped disseminate work. The membership of these groups was designed to represent a range of different types of organisations in the energy sector, and broader digital sector where relevant. Open Energy is guided by our principle of \u2018by the sector, for the sector\u2019 and we will review our governance beyond Phase 3 to ensure we continue to align with this principle. Open Energy members can apply to join the Advisory and Steering Groups. However, membership of these groups will not be restricted to members only and non-members may be invited to join in order to balance representation. If you are interested in participating in future Open Energy governance mechanisms please contact openenergy@icebreakerone.org . What data can be found and used through Open Energy? Open Energy supports both Open and Shared datasets containing energy, and energy-related, data. Different classes of data within the Open Energy ecosystem, assessed by their levels of sensitivity, are described in Data Sensitivity Classes . Open data Open data is defined in the Open Energy ecosystem as: \u2018Data that anyone can use, for any purpose, for free and is accessible under an Open data licence\u2019. Examples of open datasets include (non-exhaustive): Lower Super Output Layer ID ( LSOA ) data, Digest of UK Energy Statistics, and OpenStreetMap data. Open data is visible via Open Energy Search, which is free and open to all users. Open datasets provided by Open Energy members ( Data Providers ) and non-Open Energy members will both be visible. There are no barriers to accessing Open data once it is discovered - users are directed to an appropriate URL or API to access the data themselves. Open data access is not moderated via the OEGS as no additional access controls are required. Shared data Shared data is defined in the Open Energy ecosystem as: \u2018Data that is neither open nor closed, but can be shared under specific terms and conditions.\u2019 Examples of datasets currently licensed as Shared data include (non-exhaustive): primary substation capacity, network outage data, weather predictions, European space agency data, Electralink daily smart meter installations, certain geolocation information for energy assets and building typologies. As illustrated in these examples, Shared data is extremely diverse and can include datasets with a range of different commercial, personal and security sensitivity levels. To provide nuance in this area, Open Energy consultations have established a set of five data sensitivity classes, in which three classes describe separate categories of Shared data. Due to the sheer diversity of data types in the energy sector, Open Energy had to limit focus for Phase 3 development. At present, the OEGS can facilitate the sharing of non-personal Shared data classes only. This means that currently, sharing of non-aggregated personal data (including datasets using forms of anonymisation other than aggregation conforming to ICO / ONS best practice) is not permitted in the Open Energy ecosystem. Functionality to share personal data (class OE-SP ), and data that has been anonymised using techniques other than aggregation, may be extensible in future subject to further consultation. The metadata and sensitivity class of Shared datasets are listed in Open Energy Search and are visible to any user. Shared datasets provided by Open Energy members ( Data Providers ) and non-Open Energy members are both visible (where the latter are known), as described later in this section. Access to Shared datasets provided by Open Energy members is moderated through the Open Energy Governance Service, on the basis of preemptive licensing. Access to Shared data listed on the Search that is not provided by an Open Energy member is not supported - users should contact the non-member organisation directly to arrange access. Closed data Closed data is defined in the Open Energy ecosystem as: \u2018Data that either cannot be shared or requires a per-use, custom licence negotiated on a case-by-case basis\u2019. Under our current model, closed data is never suitable to share within the Open Energy ecosystem and is not visible through Open Energy Search. While we acknowledge industry feedback flagging potential value in using Open Energy infrastructure to privately share Closed data not listed in the Search or OEGS Directory, this is not a focus of project development in the present phase. Any extensibility of this function in future will be subject to consultation. What role does your organisation play in the Open Energy ecosystem? Members of the Open Energy ecosystem have different roles: Data Providers , Data Consumers , or both. This section outlines the meaning of the different roles and outlines their basic responsibilities. Data Providers Data Providers are organisations that control datasets that they wish to make visible and/or accessible through the Open Energy ecosystem. Data Providers can provide Open and/or Shared datasets. Data Providers are responsible for: data sensitivity classification, creation of access rules, creation of capability grants, data provision, data integrity and correctness, metadata provision, and API availability, stability and change management. Full guidance regarding Data Provider responsibilities can be found in Guidance for Data Providers . Data Consumers Data Consumers are organisations that seek to find and access datasets through the Open Energy Governance Service Service. Data Consumers can be established to serve internal organisational needs, to serve external customers, or both. Data Consumers is a catch-all term referring to all parties accessing data via the OEGS . Full guidance can be found in Guidance for Data Consumers Service Providers Data Consumers who access data to serve external customers, potentially including customers outside the Open Energy ecosystem, are categorised as a specific type of Data Consumer called a Service Provider . See Data Consumer vs Service Provider . Dual Roles Organisations wishing to both provide and access data through the Open Energy ecosystem are able to do so, so long as they fulfill the responsibilities of both roles. Data Providers who do not want to register as Data Consumers , but who wish to access Open Energy datasets, are able to do so by using the services of a Service Provider (a type of Data Consumer in the Open Energy ecosystem that provides services to customers, potentially including non Open Energy members). How does dataset access and licensing operate under Open Energy? Open Energy has consulted publicly and with industry on policies pertaining to: the types of conditions on which data access controls can be based, the process by which Data Providers establish access rules for a dataset, and the model for associating access rules with the grant of particular capabilities and obligations (licensing model). These policies are outlined briefly below, and set out in full detail in Section 3 of the Operational Guidelines. Types of Access Conditions Open Energy has established a set of conditions which may be specified for Data Consumers to meet in order to gain access to datasets in different sensitivity classes. These include, but are not limited to: payment, security compliance, regulatory compliance, standards compliance, group-based access, and use case-based access. Creating Access Rules (Introduction) To operationalise Data Access conditions above, we propose a system whereby access grants are determined, for each request to the API of a Data Provider , on the basis of a set of rules defined and published by that Data Provider in the dataset metadata. Data Licensing (Introduction) A data licence is a legal instrument setting out what a Data Consumer can do with a particular artefact (e.g. dataset). This grants certain \u2018capabilities\u2019 to the Data Consumer , comprising a clear expression of things they can do with the artefact. Capability grants are accompanied by any obligations that the Data Consumer must abide by when exercising a capability. The capabilities and obligations associated with each API call will be converted into a licence through the Open Energy Governance Service ( OEGS ). Open Energy operates through a range of standardised capability grants and obligations. Standardisation includes legal text, \u2018human readable\u2019 text and summary notation. Data Providers must specify which capabilities and obligations are associated with each access rule, and publish this transparently in the dataset metadata. Future development of the guidelines This version of the guidelines contains details of operational requirements defined within Phase 3 (ending 31 July 2021). The guidelines are designed as an iterative document that will develop in accordance with future phases of Open Energy.

The guidelines are supplemented by links to more detailed technical and membership documentation. Overarching aims of these operational guidelines: To deliver a safe and effective Open Energy ecosystem that meets the needs of members and supports the broader sector transition to Net Zero by enabling better discovery and sharing of data via a robust trust framework. To support the operational requirements of Data Providers and Data Consumers , stimulating an active Open Energy ecosystem. This includes ensuring that all members understand the sensitivity classes, access, and licensing models for data shared in the ecosystem. To encourage an active data sharing ecosystem in which transparency and interoperability are incentivised. To ensure positive member experiences that demonstrate the value of Open Energy and encourage them to continue participating in the ecosystem. To minimise potential costs associated with insufficient API or other technical system testing, downtime, or other common faults. To reduce any reputational risks associated with individual members, incorrect application of core policies, or the Open Energy ecosystem as a whole. These guidelines are structured in six sections, outlining: Introduction (this section): background to the Open Energy project, clarifications of the roles and responsibilities of different types of actors operating in the Open Energy ecosystem. Open Energy Glossary : definitions of common acronyms, terminology, and technical tools used in Open Energy documentation. Considerations Before You Start : \u2018at a glance\u2019 list of items that all types of new members will need to consider in order to meet operational requirements. NOTE : The Considerations before you start is still in review and so is not present in this version of the documentation Core Policies : operational principles and policies central to Open Energy function. Includes policies governing data sensitivity classification, access controls, and licensing. Guidance for Data Consumers and Guidance for Data Providers : guidelines outlining how Data Providers can share data safely and securely via the Open Energy ecosystem while retaining strong control, provide appropriate and timely metadata, and design safe and effective APIs enabling data-sharing. Guidelines outlining how Data Consumers can meet the requirements for offering data services, access and licensing conditions for different data classes, and best practice with regards to testing, security, ethics and dispute management. Additional Material : links to other relevant documentation (e.g. technical, legal, etc.) sitting outside the operational guidelines. WARNING : Disclaimer : The contents of the Operational Guidelines do not constitute legal advice. While they have been drafted with regard to relevant regulatory provisions and best practice, they are not a complete list of the regulatory or legal obligations that apply to members and users of Open Energy. Although intended to be consistent with relevant regulations and laws, in the event of any conflict, those regulations and laws will take priority. Participants are responsible for their own compliance with all applicable regulations and laws, including but not limited to: data protection and privacy, consumer protection laws, and energy sector licences and codes (where applicable). The Open Energy operational guidelines will be revised in future in accordance with further development of services offered in the ecosystem, or changes to the regulatory and policy environment in which it operates.

Open Energy makes it easier to discover, share, access and use energy and related datasets, supporting the sector\u2019s drive towards decarbonisation and its related social and economic benefits. Open Energy received initial development funding from the Modernising Energy Data Access competition, backed by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ( BEIS ), and Innovate UK . The project has built on learning from Open Banking - identifying which elements are transferable to the energy sector, and which require adaptation or fresh thinking. Throughout this process, the Open Energy team has engaged in extensive consultation with the energy sector, in order to ensure that the project meets the widest possible variety of needs. The ethos of Open Energy will remain grounded in sector engagement and a collaborative approach as the project moves forward. Open Energy aims to serve all actors in the energy sector, and appropriate parts of allied sectors, who are looking to share data, access data, or both. Membership is open to a wide range of organisations - from large corporations through to charities, researchers, or community groups. Both Open : and Shared Data can flow within the Open Energy ecosystem.","title":"What is Open Energy, how was it made and who is it for?"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/introduction/#how-is-open-energy-structured","text":"Open Energy consists of two core functions: dataset search and discovery, and the Open Energy Governance Service.

Open Energy Search empowers users to find out what datasets exist and who owns/controls them. Search results also outline the sensitivity class , access rules , and capability grants associated with a certain dataset, meaning that access and licensing details are transparent. This works through a search engine designed specifically to search for datasets, with options to search by different parameters in order to refine results. It can also be used to discover datasets adjacent to searches; helping users to build up a more rounded picture of the energy data landscape in their sphere of interest. Open Energy search is free, available to all, and will remain so. Access pathways to Open and Shared data are described in the following section. Datasets provided by Open Energy members ( Data Providers ) and non-Open Energy members (e.g. web scraped Open Data) may both be visible in Open Energy Search. Datasets provided by an Open Energy member will be demarcated with a green tick to indicate that the provenance of the dataset has been verified, uptime is monitored, documentation format is known, and users have a mechanism to provide feedback on the dataset if issues are detected.

Shared Data accessed via the OEGS will be provided by members only ( Data Providers ). The Governance Service aims to provide a secure, trusted mechanism to improve data sharing across the sector by reducing the time and financial costs currently associated with accessing Shared data. For providers of Shared data, the Governance Service offers a secure and effective way to list datasets and set appropriate access and licensing requirements. For actors wishing to access Shared data, the Governance Service provides a mechanism to reduce friction and bilateral contract negotiation, even when requesting access to multiple datasets from different providers.","title":"Governance Service"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/introduction/#project-governance","text":"During Phase 3, Open Energy was governed by two Advisory Groups (Membership and Delivery) and a Steering Group. The groups met once a month and a brief description of each group\u2019s activities is given below. Membership Advisory Group : Consulted on the Membership contract, key policies, including conditions to participate, roles, responsibilities and liabilities, draft preemptive licence, funding model, operational guidelines, and ongoing governance. Delivery Advisory Group : Consulted on the drafting of operational guidelines and understanding data production and usage. Fed into the requirements for technical delivery of the Open Energy Governance Service and the Energy Data Search to ensure they meet user needs. Alongside this, examined the day-to-day operational aspects of Open Energy including security and systems. Steering Group : Supported the overarching strategy, ensured the delivery of our objectives, and helped disseminate work. The membership of these groups was designed to represent a range of different types of organisations in the energy sector, and broader digital sector where relevant. Open Energy is guided by our principle of \u2018by the sector, for the sector\u2019 and we will review our governance beyond Phase 3 to ensure we continue to align with this principle. Open Energy members can apply to join the Advisory and Steering Groups.

Applicable standards We use a strict sub-set of the FAPI specification for interactions between Data Providers and Data Consumers . The applicable standards are linked here for reference, we reference the precise elements of these standards in later sections. RFC6749 The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework RFC6750 The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage OpenID Connect Core 1.0 RFC8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens Discovery of endpoint URLs While not strictly necessary, the authorization server deployed as part of the OEGS implements the OpenID Connect Discovery provider configuration information endpoint as described here , references in this document to e.g. token_endpoint refer to properties discoverable in this fashion. Token acquisition In order to access a shared data API , a Data Consumer must first acquire an access token. This is done by sending an HTTP request to the authorization server (part of the OEGS ). The Data Consumer MUST : Use Mutual TLS , presenting a client certificate when requested. This is the tls_client_auth authentication method described in section 2 of RFC8705 . * In our implementation, this certificate is acquired by creating a `transport certificate` in a software statement within the OEGS directory Use the client_credentials grant type Send a POST request to the token_endpoint of the authorization server containing the following properties as application/x-www-form-urlencoded key / value pairs: client_id : <CLIENT_ID> scope: <REQUESTED_SCOPES> grant_type: client_credentials Scope may be omitted, for most uses within Open Energy there is no requirement to specify a scope. CLIENT_ID can be obtained from the software statement within the directory corresponding to this client A successful call to the token_endpoint is indicated by a 200 response code, in which case the body of the response will contain a JSON object with at least two properties: access_token is an opaque string to be used as a bearer token for requests to resource servers (a Data Consumer shared data API in our context) expires_in is an integer number of seconds from the current time, after which the token will no longer be valid after this point the Data Consumer MUST request a new token in order to continue to access shared data resources Token usage - calling a shared data API To call a shared data API within a Data Provider , the Data Consumer MUST: Use Mutual TLS as previously described Pass the previously acquired bearer token in an HTTP header: Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> In addition, the Data Consumer SHOULD : Specify an interaction ID for this call in an HTTP header: x-fapi-interaction-id: <UUID> This allows for tracking of transactions between clients and resource servers, aiding troubleshooting. We use a UUID4 in our reference implementation Request validation To participate in the Open Energy ecosystem, a Data Provider MUST : Expose an HTTPS API Perform validation on any requests to this API Reject any requests which do not present a valid client certificate. Client certificates are validated in the context of the root CAs provided by the OEGS directory. Reject any requests which do not provide an Authorization header containing a Bearer token as described above If any of the above checks fail, the Data Provider MUST NOT continue processing the request, and SHOULD respond with an error response as defined in this section of RFC6750 Token introspection If all the above checks pass, the Data Provider MUST then validate the presented token. Tokens in our case are opaque identifiers (as opposed to JWTs) and must be passed to the introspection_endpoint of the authorization server to obtain additional information. To obtain this introspection response, the Data Provider MUST : Make a POST request to the introspection_endpoint of the authorization server Use Mutual TLS , this means Data Providers must also have a provisioned client within the OEGS directory in the form of a software statement and corresponding transport certificate Send the bearer token and client ID of the Data Provider as an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body with the following values: token: <BEARER_TOKEN> client_id: <CLIENT_ID> Introspection response validation The response body of this introspection call contains a JSON object with information about the entity which requested the supplied token from the authorization server, as well as properties of the token itself. An example introspection response is shown below: { \"active\": true, \"organisation_id\": \"8\", \"organisation_name\": \"A Demo Provider\", \"organisation_number\": \"8\", \"software_roles\": [ \"EDSP_L1\" ], \"software_description\": \"Description: https://www.demo.org.uk/ is the location of our demo server\", \"additional_software_metadata\": { \"metadata\": { \"something\": \"something else\" } }, \"client_id\": \"kZuAsn7UyZ98Wwh29hDpf\", \"exp\": 1626279245, \"iat\": 1626278645, \"iss\": \"https://auth.directory.energydata.org.uk\", \"scope\": \"directory:software\", \"cnf\": { \"x5t#S256\": \"rP_-9u3ZyVo4ryQxg-bn4rr6gJGNu1dTowEeppOuIt8\" }, \"token_type\": \"Bearer\" } The following elements of the introspection response MUST be validated further before any Open Energy specific processing is performed: active If the introspection response does not contain the key active , or the value of this key is anything other than the boolean true value, the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease further processing. If the active key was not present, it SHOULD respond with 400 invalid_request If the active key was present but not true it SHOULD respond with 401 invalid_token time ranges If the introspection response contains iat this is interpreted as a number of seconds since the epoch at which the token was issued. If this is in the future the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease further processing. It SHOULD respond with a 401 invalid_token . NOTE : The Data Provider SHOULD allow for a reasonable degree of clock skew when interpreting the iat timestamp, an allowance of no more than 10 seconds should cover all reasonable cases. If the introspection response contains exp this is interpreted as a number of seconds since the epoch after which the token should be considered invalid. If this is in the past, the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease further processing. It SHOULD respond with a 401 invalid_token certificate thumbprint Open Energy uses certificate pinning combined with MTLS on all requests between Data Consumers and Data Providers . This ensures that a token issued to one client cannot be re-used by another client. Data Providers MUST check that the thumbprint of the presented client certificate matches that provided within the introspection response. The introspection response contains the SHA256 thumbprint of the certificate used to acquire the token as a nested property ['cnf']['x5t#S256'] . This MUST be equal to the SHA256 thumbprint of the client certificate, if this is not the case the Data Provider MUST reject the request and cease any further processing, responding with a 401 invalid_token Interaction header If the x-fapi-interaction-id header is set in the request, it MUST be set to the same value in the response header of the same name. If not set, a new ID MUST be generated and set in the response header. Other validation If all the above checks have passed, the Data Provider can service the request and return whatever data were requested. It MAY , however, apply additional checks based on information in the introspection response about the client. This is where any Open Energy specific access control and licensing policies are applied. To inform any additional processing, the Data Provider MAY make use of the ['additional_client_metadata']['metadata'] key within the introspection response. This contains a JSON object with properties asserted about the Data Consumer . The exact set of properties is not defined here, please see the access control language specification for more information about what could be specified. Data Providers MAY make use of the organisation_id field in the token introspection response to uniquely and consistently identify the organisation of the Data Consumer where required, for example to reference a customer record within the Data Provider .

CLIENT_ID can be obtained from the software statement within the directory corresponding to this client A successful call to the token_endpoint is indicated by a 200 response code, in which case the body of the response will contain a JSON object with at least two properties: access_token is an opaque string to be used as a bearer token for requests to resource servers (a Data Consumer shared data API in our context) expires_in is an integer number of seconds from the current time, after which the token will no longer be valid after this point the Data Consumer MUST request a new token in order to continue to access shared data resources","title":"Token acquisition"},{"location":"ops_guidelines/technical_common/#token-usage-calling-a-shared-data-api","text":"To call a shared data API within a Data Provider , the Data Consumer MUST: Use Mutual TLS as previously described Pass the previously acquired bearer token in an HTTP header: Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> In addition, the Data Consumer SHOULD : Specify an interaction ID for this call in an HTTP header: x-fapi-interaction-id: <UUID> This allows for tracking of transactions between clients and resource servers, aiding troubleshooting.
