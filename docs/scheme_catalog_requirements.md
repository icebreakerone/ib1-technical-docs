# Scheme Catalog Requirements

A Scheme Catalog Requirements Document specifies the metadata that a DCAT Catalog entry must contain for it to be Scheme-conforming, representing a data source that meets a common standard across a Scheme to provide the same format and meaning of data across all Data Providers.

It is an RDF document published by the Registry.
